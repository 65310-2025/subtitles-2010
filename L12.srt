1
0-1:59:59,500 --> 00:00:02,654

2
00:00:02,654 --> 00:00:04,320
PROFESSOR: Today we're
going to continue

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,980
our theme of linkage
folding, but we're

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,040
going to generalize
our notion of linkage.

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,970
And so we want to go
beyond folding just

6
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:15,132
one-dimensional structures
in two dimensions, which

7
00:00:15,132 --> 00:00:17,340
is what we've been talking
about the last two classes

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,090
for the most part.

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,870
We did a little bit in 3-D.

10
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,274
But Carpenter's Rule theorem is
about unfolding these things.

11
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:24,690
We talked about
locked trees, when

12
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,580
you add degree
three vertices here.

13
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,090
I want to make things a
little harder and more

14
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:39,240
interesting by adding fat
objects to those edges.

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,190
So these are solid regions.

16
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,270
You could think of
them as polygons,

17
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:52,070
but they could also be smooth--
whatever, lines, circles,

18
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,070
whatever you want.

19
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,300
They're still hinged at
points, and they still

20
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,110
fold like this
underlying linkage.

21
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,489
But now the collision
constraint is even worse.

22
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:03,280
Not only are the bars
not allowed to touch,

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,310
but these blobs that
are attached to the bars

24
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,940
are not allowed to
cross each other.

25
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,550
Question?

26
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:13,300
AUDIENCE: Isn't it kind of
like a rigid sub-linkage?

27
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,080
PROFESSOR: Yeah
it's kind of like,

28
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,370
say this was a polygon
because everything's almost

29
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,760
a polygon-- everything's
linear to the first order.

30
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,230
So you could just
triangulate this guy

31
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,510
and say, yeah that's just like
a more complicated linkage.

32
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,770
Now this moves as
a rigid object,

33
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,720
and it can't collide
with anything else.

34
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,410
You can even over-brace it if
you want-- add lots of bars--

35
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,861
but it will move the same.

36
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:37,360
Of course, then you
have collisions,

37
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,580
so that's kind of cheating.

38
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,205
But if you triangulate, you
will get the same behavior

39
00:01:42,205 --> 00:01:45,030
as these rigid objects, yeah.

40
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,040
Now, we know that
as soon as you go--

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,430
as soon as you have a vertex
of degree more than two,

42
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,370
things can lock.

43
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,350
So it's no surprise that
these things can lock.

44
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,140
What's surprising is that you
can prove interesting things

45
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,200
about them not locking.

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,710
Let's start with some simple
examples of them locking.

47
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,170
So these are triangles
hinged together

48
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,300
at points that are locked.

49
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,330
And this field
began back in '98.

50
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,650
This is when we were
working on locked trees.

51
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,810
Marty, our cameraman, was
working on locked triangles,

52
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,860
and after a day he came
up with these examples.

53
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,860
They're not too hard to find.

54
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,780
This is probably the
most compelling one.

55
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,900
You have on the top
those obtuse triangles.

56
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,320
And because they share
an edge like that,

57
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,350
they can really
only hinge one way.

58
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,880
They can only close this angle.

59
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,880
They can't open it, and
so this guy's stuck.

60
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,220
It can't get out.

61
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,520
This is a little
trickier, but what's

62
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,090
interesting about
this example is

63
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,837
all the triangles
are equilateral.

64
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:48,670
It's pretty special.

65
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,390
If you were hoping for
some good results here,

66
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,931
you think, well
equilateral triangle.

67
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:54,600
Those are the simplest,
nice shapes I know.

68
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,417
So maybe they work.

69
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:56,250
But they don't work.

70
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,900
They can lock.

71
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,680
This may be a
little less obvious

72
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,500
because this guy's
reaching around on the top,

73
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,020
can't unwind if this is
drawn sufficiently tight.

74
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,820
And in fact, it's pretty
obvious because we

75
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,190
could apply rule one right here.

76
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,080
It's an edge spanned
by two acute angles,

77
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,720
so that glues in there.

78
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,580
Then you have a rigid triangle
here, so that stays co-linear

79
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,095
and then you're screwed.

80
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:26,470
Then the only thing that could
move is that top triangle,

81
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,710
and it can't get out.

82
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:33,720
So the self-touching
version is rigid,

83
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,920
and therefore any perturbation
is strongly locked.

84
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,560
So we can use the same tools we
did-- because you could ignore

85
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,170
the fact that these
are solid things.

86
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,180
So just think of them as
triangles, as linkages.

87
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,240
And we could still use
rules one, and two,

88
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,540
and rigidity, and
strongly locked, and all

89
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,750
those good things, and prove
that these things are locked.

90
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,500
And we'll do that some later.

91
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,200
But I claim it's useful to
think about rigid shapes being

92
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,260
attached to bars.

93
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,940
Because in particular, we know
how to unfold things like this.

94
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,324
So maybe there are
certain kinds of shapes

95
00:04:11,324 --> 00:04:12,240
that you could attach.

96
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,990
Maybe if I just thickened
it a little bit,

97
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,589
maybe that wouldn't
matter too much.

98
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:21,320
We know that if you add
equilateral triangles,

99
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,250
that can lock.

100
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,110
But what if I add some
very small, thin triangles

101
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,050
to these edges?

102
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,100
Well then it turns
out you can't lock

103
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,200
for the appropriate
definition of thin.

104
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:41,800
So this is the idea of
an adorned chain, where

105
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:49,180
you have rigid shapes
attached to bars.

106
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,720

107
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,080
So the bars guide the motion.

108
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,470
We're going to think
about the underlying

109
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,069
linkage, the
underlying chain here,

110
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:03,360
and then there are these
rigid shapes attached to them.

111
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,760
They come along for the ride.

112
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,750
And in particular-- blah,
blah, blah, all right

113
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,990
we have some terminology.

114
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,510

115
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:26,122
An adornment in general
looks something like this.

116
00:05:26,122 --> 00:05:32,120
This is rigid region,
but it has this segment

117
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,900
marked on it called the base.

118
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,680
The rest is the shape.

119
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,200

120
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,600
So as the bar moves,
you just rigidly move

121
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,070
the shape so that the base
lines up with the bar.

122
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,550
And that's how
they follow along.

123
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,440

124
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,180
And now we can define
the notion of thin,

125
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,238
except we call it slender.

126
00:06:00,238 --> 00:06:03,550
A little nicer.

127
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,605
The best thing
about mathematics is

128
00:06:05,605 --> 00:06:06,995
you get to make up terminology.

129
00:06:06,995 --> 00:06:09,569

130
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,110
Not the best thing,
but a cool thing.

131
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,840

132
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,510
At some point, my dad was
having dinner with a group

133
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,760
and saying, yeah that's great.

134
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,134
We've made up all
these fun words

135
00:06:20,134 --> 00:06:21,940
like slender on
un-unfoldable which

136
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,190
is something we'll talk about.

137
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,967
And it's like what words
have you guys made up?

138
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:28,050
And one guy raised his
hand an said, oh, Ethernet.

139
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,130

140
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,180
We're not that cool.

141
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,950
All right, so what does
slender adornment mean?

142
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:45,960

143
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,930
It's going to be shapes
more like these thin things.

144
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,000
Maybe even these, I think,
but not so much this.

145
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,241
That doesn't look
so slender to me.

146
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:57,740
What we're going
to do is walk along

147
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:05,710
the boundary from one base
endpoint to the other.

148
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,320

149
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,300
So let me draw an example here.

150
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,425
I think that'll be slender.

151
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:17,370

152
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,630
So we start here, we walk
along in this direction.

153
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,430
And what we want is that this
motion, as you walk along

154
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:39,840
there you monatonically increase
your distance to the endpoint

155
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,950
you started at, the
former endpoint.

156
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:50,397
And also, sort of equivalently,
you decrease the distance

157
00:07:50,397 --> 00:07:52,480
to the other endpoint, the
one you're approaching.

158
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,060

159
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,860
And this should be true no
matter how you get there.

160
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,420
So I'm walking in this
along this outer boundary,

161
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,180
and I'm looking.

162
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,390
What is the distance
to this end point?

163
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,630
I can just draw a whole
bunch of concentric circles

164
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,030
around that point.

165
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,570
As long as these circles only
hit my curve once, I'm happy.

166
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,480
That means this distance is
increasing monotonically.

167
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,080
But you should also draw
them from the other side.

168
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,040

169
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,450
It's like offset curves, good
old straight skeleton stuff.

170
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,350
And lo and behold,
you monatonically

171
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,789
move outward from here if you
went this direction, outward

172
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,340
from here if you
went that direction.

173
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,874
And this should be true for
both sides of the curve.

174
00:08:41,874 --> 00:08:43,175
This one looks like, yeah.

175
00:08:43,175 --> 00:08:44,870
It monotonically
increases distance

176
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,950
from here, decreases from there
as you move right to left.

177
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,490
That's slender.

178
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,210
Pretty simple definition.

179
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:58,140
The biggest slender shape you
could hope for-- the biggest

180
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:05,240
one that you can do-- is if you
draw one giant circle centered

181
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,150
at each of the
points, and passing

182
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,470
through the other endpoint.

183
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:16,900

184
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,730
That's slender.

185
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,140
I know it looks pretty fat.

186
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,520
This is like a
Reuleaux triangle,

187
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,744
but that's still slender.

188
00:09:23,744 --> 00:09:25,660
And if you go outside
that, you're in trouble.

189
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,235
Then you won't be monatonic.

190
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:31,380
If I went here and came back,
I'm getting farther away,

191
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,380
but then I'm getting
closer again to this point.

192
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,465
So that's not allowed.

193
00:09:34,465 --> 00:09:37,650

194
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,310
Cool, so that's
slender adornments.

195
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,710
There's actually a couple of
different ways to define it.

196
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,159
And-- yeah, question?

197
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,033
AUDIENCE: Can you fit
an equilateral triangle

198
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:47,960
within that?

199
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,150
PROFESSOR: Yes.

200
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,210
So I don't mean to say that
if you take any-- you can fit

201
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,340
an equilateral triangle
in there, I think.

202
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,415
Well, like this.

203
00:09:56,415 --> 00:09:58,360
An equilateral triangle
is not slender.

204
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,190
We can check that.

205
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,330
I know it's weird.

206
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,630
It's not a monoton definition.

207
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,770
If you take a subset
of your slender shape,

208
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,120
the result will not
necessarily be slender.

209
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:15,780
So if we do equilateral,
if you draw a circle--

210
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,860
there's a circle here that's
going to kiss this edge.

211
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,610
It's centered here and it kisses
this edge of the triangle.

212
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,340
So that means you're going
out and then coming back,

213
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,766
getting closer again.

214
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:30,390
So equilateral triangle
is not slender.

215
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,150
That's good, because we know
equilateral triangles can lock.

216
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,710
So it better not be slender,
because I'm going to say that

217
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,216
slender chains cannot lock.

218
00:10:38,216 --> 00:10:40,430
That's what we're
going to prove.

219
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:40,930
I

220
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,388
Let me give you
another definition.

221
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:44,540
It's a little bit
easier to work with

222
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,380
and also gives some
intuition about why

223
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,940
slender things are good.

224
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,031

225
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:53,155
Well, it will give some
intuition, not immediately.

226
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:56,110

227
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:01,470
If you look at inward
normals from the shape,

228
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,500
then they hit the base.

229
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:13,520

230
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,850
This is assuming that my
shape is somewhat smooth,

231
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,790
but it's not a big deal.

232
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:22,520
So let me take a
nice shape again.

233
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,690
If I look, here's a tangent,
here's an inward normal.

234
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,960
I extend it, it hits the base.

235
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,930
All of these inward
normals hit the base.

236
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,180
That's good.

237
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,776
In this case, I could
take an inward normal from

238
00:11:37,776 --> 00:11:40,234
here-- say, if you don't want
to do the corner because it's

239
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:41,510
a little confusing.

240
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:45,440
And you will go-- here
you don't hit the base.

241
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,330
You hit this line of course.

242
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:51,000
Unless you happen to be
parallel, you'll hit the line.

243
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,720
But I want it to actually
hit the line segment that

244
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,150
is the base of the shape.

245
00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:03,490
And maybe go back up here,
the Reuleaux triangle,

246
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,345
you take one of the
inward normals here,

247
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:08,252
it will actually just
barely hit the base.

248
00:12:08,252 --> 00:12:09,210
It hits it at a vertex.

249
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,509
That's, OK because
this is slender.

250
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:13,550
That's why if you went a
little bit outside, then

251
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,812
you'd have an inward normal
that doesn't hit the base.

252
00:12:16,812 --> 00:12:18,270
So it's pretty
easy, given a shape,

253
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,550
to tell whether it is slender.

254
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:25,070
Just draw a bunch of inward
normals and it either works

255
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,084
or it doesn't.

256
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:28,000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

257
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,810

258
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,140
PROFESSOR: If you make some
complex thing like that,

259
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,910
that's not going to be slender.

260
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,910
Now, you could take
something called the slender

261
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,430
hull-- I'll define
that in a moment.

262
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,150
Here's another definition.

263
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,630
It's a union of half-lenses.

264
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:54,750

265
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,370
Half-lenses I want to define
sort of like this Reuleaux

266
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,580
triangle example.

267
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,430

268
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,760
But I don't necessarily take
these vertices as the center.

269
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,302
I take some vertex
here as the center.

270
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:11,740
Let's say I take
two of them and I

271
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,200
draw a circle centered
here passing through here--

272
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,390
so that's like this--
a circle centered here

273
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,540
passing through here--
that's like this.

274
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,820
I'm getting better
at drawing circles.

275
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,340
That's my half-lens.

276
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,270
If I drew the whole thing,
that would be a lens.

277
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,280
So you get a choice.

278
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,900
Now I could maybe choose
this point and this point

279
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,710
and draw a circle here and here.

280
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,250
And then there's
another half-lens.

281
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,410
If you take a whole bunch of
those, union them together,

282
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,860
that will always be slender.

283
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,070
That's kind of
obvious, because you

284
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,720
look at any of these
inward normals,

285
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,095
they're going to
hit one of these

286
00:13:46,095 --> 00:13:47,527
x's that you drew on the line.

287
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,860
What's a little less obvious
is that every slender shape

288
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,560
can be made by a
bunch of these things.

289
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,880
Now admittedly, possibly
infinitely many of them.

290
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,530
If my shape-- one of my
favorite slender shapes

291
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,390
is a right triangle.

292
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,990

293
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,260
And you can check all the
inward normals hit the base.

294
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:12,370
Here they just
barely hit the base.

295
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,020
Obviously you need an infinite--
all of these half-lenses

296
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,310
are curved.

297
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,800
But if you take an appropriate
infinite number of them, namely

298
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,740
all the points here, there
is a lens that covers it.

299
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,940
You just take all of those--
I'm not drawing them perfectly,

300
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,872
but they'll look
something like that.

301
00:14:29,872 --> 00:14:31,330
You take the union
of all of those,

302
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,790
that'll give you the triangle.

303
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:36,660
So in fact, any shape
you want to make slender

304
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,480
you take the lens
that hits every point.

305
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,105
So this is the slender hull.

306
00:14:40,105 --> 00:14:43,870

307
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,620
If you have some shape
that's not slender,

308
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,250
this is really ugly, they're
inward normals that go up.

309
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,740
But I can fill it
in, I don't know

310
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,150
exactly what this
will look like.

311
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,300
But for example, this
point is kind of bad.

312
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,930
It's got an inward
normal going up.

313
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,395
So I'll take the slender hull.

314
00:15:00,395 --> 00:15:06,430
I'll take some-- did I lie?

315
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,840

316
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,830
I think it's even simpler.

317
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,610
Let me check.

318
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,430
Yeah, I was more
complicated than I

319
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,450
have to be for half-lenses.

320
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,720
This does work, it'll
still be slander.

321
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,410
But you can be-- in
fact, because you

322
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,750
need to be monotonic the
whole way around, you

323
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,790
might as well always use
these two points as centers.

324
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,820
It's been a while since
I've seen this stuff.

325
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,650
So if I had some
point like this,

326
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,230
it'd be a little bit nicer if
I took circle centered here,

327
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,690
and a circle centered way over
there so it's almost vertical.

328
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,060
That's also half-lens.

329
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,980
That will be smaller.

330
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,646
I can, of course,
add more stuff later,

331
00:15:43,646 --> 00:15:45,270
but that's the minimum
you can get away

332
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,830
with is that half-lens.

333
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,630
If I want to add
this point, it's

334
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,500
going to be something like that.

335
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,576
Circle centered here and
here, and that's my half-lens.

336
00:15:55,576 --> 00:15:56,950
So that actually
uniquely defines

337
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,491
what you want to do here, which
is you take a circle centered

338
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:02,740
at this point, you take a
circle centered at this point,

339
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,330
and you add that to your shape.

340
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,620
And so in general,
in this example

341
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,550
it's going to fill in
something like that.

342
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,520
This might be OK.

343
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,000
It might fill in
a little bit here.

344
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,910
It's going to fill in something.

345
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,735
So then this shape
will be slender.

346
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,360
So if you have some shape
that's not quite slender,

347
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,470
and it's messy and ugly, you
could fill it in like this.

348
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,450
And as long as that
fill-in doesn't intersect

349
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,670
with any other shapes,
you're still OK.

350
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,610
So if you have some crazy
collection of shapes,

351
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,304
you fill them in with
the slender hull,

352
00:16:35,304 --> 00:16:36,970
and they're still not
self-intersecting,

353
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,803
then you know that thing
will not be locked.

354
00:16:38,803 --> 00:16:40,902
Of course, if the fill-in
doesn't intersect,

355
00:16:40,902 --> 00:16:42,610
and you can move it
without intersection,

356
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,470
then the original
thing won't intersect.

357
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,240
So that's good.

358
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,404
Now of course, if you have
crazy interlocked shapes,

359
00:16:48,404 --> 00:16:49,820
well those are
going to be locked.

360
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,170
So you're in trouble.

361
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,574
Something like this.

362
00:16:54,574 --> 00:16:56,740
And then when you take the
slender hull, you'll see,

363
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:01,132
oh they're overlapped so I don't
know what's going to happen.

364
00:17:01,132 --> 00:17:03,340
Of course, we're not going
to be able to characterize

365
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,934
every collection of shapes
that lock, slender gives you

366
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:11,260
a pretty good idea
of when they do,

367
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,310
when you're guaranteed safe.

368
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,300
Oh, I think I even
have to a figure

369
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,440
of a whole bunch
of slender things.

370
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:26,274
On the top we have mostly
half-lenses-- actually

371
00:17:26,274 --> 00:17:27,190
they're all symmetric.

372
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,090
In this case, I took
lenses, not half-lenses,

373
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,250
but you could just take the
upper half or the bottom half.

374
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,200
You can take regular Kgons,
circles, half circles,

375
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,110
Reuleaux triangles, various
combinations thereof.

376
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,970
Lots of shapes are slender.

377
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,810
You can take this
on one side and this

378
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,400
on the other side of the
edge, whatever you want.

379
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,270
Or just put an
adornment on one side.

380
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,010

381
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,025
Many things are slender.

382
00:17:52,025 --> 00:17:58,450

383
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:04,720
So we want to prove, if
you have a slender chain,

384
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,520
you are not locked.

385
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,880

386
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,044
That's the theorem
from 2006 originally.

387
00:18:14,044 --> 00:18:15,460
The journal version
just appeared.

388
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:19,240

389
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,750
And the way we're going to prove
that-- as you might guess--

390
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,333
is using the Carpenter's
Rule theorem.

391
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,610
We have this underlying chain,
we know how to unfold that.

392
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,440
Maybe if we're lucky,
slender adornments

393
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,210
won't mess up the
Carpenter's Rule of motion.

394
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:39,390
And in general, if you take an
arbitrary unfolding of a chain,

395
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,350
you have no idea
what's going to happen.

396
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:45,190
Maybe the shapes will
intersect each other.

397
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,440
Your motion could be annoying.

398
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,930
But the Carpenter's
Rule theorem tells

399
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,221
us, not only is there a motion.

400
00:18:49,221 --> 00:18:51,640
There's a nice motion
that's expansive.

401
00:18:51,640 --> 00:19:03,255
And it turns out, as long as
you have an expensive motion

402
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:22,650
of what I call the underlying
chain, then that motion will

403
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,330
not cause any of the
pieces to intersect.

404
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,310
Assuming they don't
initially, then

405
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,430
that nonintersection will
be preserved, provided

406
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,840
your adornments are slender.

407
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:39,920

408
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,120
So that means, if we have
some slender chain, slenderly

409
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:49,220
adorned chain, say open chain,
then via an expensive motion

410
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,870
which we know exists
you'll be able to unfold

411
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,460
the chain straight.

412
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,210
And then if you want
to go somewhere else,

413
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,010
you can unfold that somewhere
else straight, and then glue

414
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:03,180
those motions together, and you
get your motion from a to b.

415
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,100

416
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,570
Let me start with
an intuitive proof.

417
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:15,110

418
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:34,220
Suppose you have two slender
shapes that are touching.

419
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,280
Suppose you're moving around.

420
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,090
If they're going to cross,
first they have to touch.

421
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,590
So consider the moment
at which they touch.

422
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,040
I claim they can't
cross from there.

423
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,790
And the intuition
is the following,

424
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:51,310
take an inward normal from--
when they touch like this,

425
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,810
they have a common tangent.

426
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,310
And so if you take the
inward normal on both sides,

427
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:59,640
those inward normals
are co-linear.

428
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,037
And you know from the
second definition--

429
00:21:02,037 --> 00:21:03,620
I didn't prove they're
all equivalent,

430
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:08,690
but they are-- that we will
get some points on the bars,

431
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:09,815
on the edges, on the bases.

432
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:12,760

433
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,600
So what?

434
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:20,200
Well, if I take
two bars-- and I'm

435
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,930
computing expansive motions,
meaning I know this distance

436
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,840
increases, this
instance increases,

437
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,050
this distance increases,
and this distance increases.

438
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,740
Those are the struts
that we added.

439
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,010
It turns out-- I've
actually used this

440
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,120
once before, I
think-- that in effect

441
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,710
if you take any two
points on the bars,

442
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,270
that distance also
has to increase.

443
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,810

444
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,930
It's pretty obvious, because
these are straight things.

445
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,410
If any point here was going
to approach any point here,

446
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,790
you would need to either
move this point closer

447
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:54,801
to the this edge or this
point closer to this edge.

448
00:21:54,801 --> 00:21:56,550
And if you move a point
closer to an edge,

449
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:59,480
one of these two edges will get
shorter and that's now allowed.

450
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,110
So if all four of
those cross distances

451
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,080
increase, then in
fact the distance

452
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,540
between any two
points on the segment

453
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,910
increase or stay the same.

454
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,430
Remember, in general
we're expansive.

455
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:15,270
There's some pairs that you
cannot strictly increase

456
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:18,850
the distances of, although
most of them we can.

457
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,080
And so that's good news.

458
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,440
If this distance increases,
it's pretty hard for them

459
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,660
to start intersecting there.

460
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,650

461
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,120
This is an intuition,
not quite a proof.

462
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,560
You can make this into a
formal proof, it's just messy.

463
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,510
The trouble is, for
example, if the distance

464
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:38,230
stays the same you can kind
of spin around that point.

465
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,790
You can move first
order left or right.

466
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,560
Maybe it's not actually
this point from this guy

467
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,900
and this point from this guy who
are going to start penetrating,

468
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,160
because as you move maybe
it's some point nearby

469
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,270
that falls inside.

470
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,370
It's a little tricky to see
who exactly can intersect what.

471
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,180
It looks good.

472
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,150
And in particular, if
this distance is strictly

473
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,830
increasing, then it pretty
much has to move away.

474
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,830
But there's a lot
of subtle details,

475
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,410
and it's kind of a mess.

476
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,809
We did it once.

477
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:05,350
But in fact, we
found a simpler proof

478
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,808
that does not have
to rely on this.

479
00:23:06,808 --> 00:23:10,230
But I still like this from
an intuitive standpoint.

480
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:15,760
It's kind of clear why that
inward normal property is good.

481
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,770
If the inward normals
hit outside the bar, then

482
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:20,260
you have no idea whether
that distance expands.

483
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,400
As long as it hits
inside, you're golden.

484
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:38,660

485
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,040
Let's start with a special case
that's really easy to prove.

486
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:48,040
It's easy to prove by
appealing to fancy mathematics.

487
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,610
They're actually pretty
old mathematics from 1934.

488
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:56,960
There wasn't a lot of math then,
and yet some great results.

489
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,250
So let's start with a symmetric
case, where you have your base,

490
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,630
you have some slender
adornment, and you

491
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,300
have exactly the reflection
of the slender adornment

492
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,420
drawn below it.

493
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,070
So it's reflectionally
symmetric about that line.

494
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,970
That's nice, because
instead of having

495
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:19,296
to worry about half-lenses I
can worry about entire lenses.

496
00:24:19,296 --> 00:24:20,910
Like a special
case, every time I

497
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:26,900
have some lens like this one--
it should look like that,

498
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,450
a circle centered here,
circle centered here,

499
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:32,020
that would be the half-lens--
I have in fact the entire lens.

500
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,530

501
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:43,009
So really if this shape is going
to intersect some other shape,

502
00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:45,050
then there's got to be
some lens over here that's

503
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,508
going to intersect
some other lens.

504
00:24:46,508 --> 00:24:49,490
So really I can just
think of a single lens,

505
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:54,820
pretty much, worry about
one lens hitting another.

506
00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:02,090
In the symmetric case, it turns
out-- what do I want to say?

507
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,710

508
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,460
This preserves not in
[INAUDIBLE] section.

509
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:17,840

510
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,270
It turns out, not only is
nonintersection preserved

511
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:24,140
under continuous motions,
which is what we care about,

512
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,520
it's preserved for what I'll
call instantaneous motions.

513
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:34,540

514
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,380
In the origami context, we
would call these folded states.

515
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,810
We don't worry about how
you got there, you just

516
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,790
draw it again differently.

517
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:46,390
It's like you instantaneously
jumped to that point.

518
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,990
So in terms of
configuration spaces,

519
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,420
we have some big
configuration space.

520
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,570
And we say, well ideally
I go somewhere by motion,

521
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,300
but maybe I just jump
over to another point.

522
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:00,580
I just redraw these
symmetric slender adornments.

523
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,610
And I should say, the
motion should still

524
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,840
be expansive in the
sense that if you measure

525
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,400
the distance between two
vertices in the original

526
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,880
and you measure the
distance between them

527
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,600
in the new resulting
configuration,

528
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,830
the distance only goes up.

529
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,900
It could stay the same
or strictly increase.

530
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:24,009

531
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:25,050
So this is kind of crazy.

532
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,800
You don't even need
continuity for this the hold

533
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,890
in the symmetric case.

534
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:42,110

535
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:49,340
So in general we're
worried about some lens.

536
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:56,017

537
00:26:56,017 --> 00:26:58,100
The lens is going to be
symmetric about this line,

538
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,260
but not necessarily
about this line.

539
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,360
We're worried about
it intersecting

540
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,800
some other lens
when that happens.

541
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,260

542
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,360
Well, here's a cool theorem.

543
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,725
And this theorem has come into
fashion in the last few years.

544
00:27:20,725 --> 00:27:27,900

545
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,000
Actually, let me tell
you a bigger result

546
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,260
called the Kneser
Poulsen Conjecture.

547
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,370
It's a conjecture I don't
know how many years ago.

548
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:38,300
It's also called,
pushing disks together.

549
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,650
I have a bunch of
disks in the plane.

550
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,190
Suppose they overlap,
who knows what

551
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,280
happens, but a bunch of disks.

552
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,950
And then I push
them all together,

553
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:50,620
meaning the opposite
of expansion.

554
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,360
All the centers of the disks
get closer to each other.

555
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:59,490
Is it the case that the area of
the union, or the intersection,

556
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,950
all these things should go down.

557
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:04,210
It seems intuitive
enough, but was

558
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:08,886
unsolved until 2002,
someone recent.

559
00:28:08,886 --> 00:28:11,360
A special case of that
turns out to be all we need.

560
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,140
There's obviously disks
lying around here.

561
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:17,610
This is the intersection of
two disks, so it seems useful.

562
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,370
Overall, there's four
disks involved here.

563
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:25,080
There's one here, one here,
one here, and one here.

564
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,540
What we really care about
are four-way intersections

565
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,900
between all four of those disks.

566
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,650
That would be bad.

567
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:33,730
That would be the two
lenses hitting each other.

568
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,660
Remember, really there's
a bigger edge here.

569
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:41,210
But if they're going to hit,
some two lenses have to hit.

570
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:51,040
And that special case
is much older, 1934.

571
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:58,540
And it says, if
we instantaneously

572
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,110
translate-- you can't
really rotate disks,

573
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,860
it doesn't change much.

574
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:07,220
Let's say we have n disks,
and we instantaneously

575
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,080
just move them around.

576
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,990
And I'm going to state
it in the expansive form.

577
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:18,470
And suppose initially
they have no intersection,

578
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:24,215
meaning they have an
empty n-way intersection.

579
00:29:24,215 --> 00:29:35,520

580
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:51,666
And we instantaneously
translate to an expansive motion

581
00:29:51,666 --> 00:30:01,610
on the centers, then
we'll still have

582
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,956
an empty n-way intersection.

583
00:30:04,956 --> 00:30:11,430

584
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:15,180
Now, in our case we
care about n equals 4.

585
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,330
We have four disks
we care about,

586
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:20,600
we somehow move
them so the centers

587
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,815
are the vertices of my chain.

588
00:30:22,815 --> 00:30:25,640
We don't even need that
[INAUDIBLE] about other points.

589
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,300
I know the centers of my
lenses are my endpoints.

590
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,405
I know all those distances
are increasing somehow.

591
00:30:32,405 --> 00:30:34,700
And now I'm even thinking
about the instantaneous case.

592
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,000
So I just pick up all those
points, drop them down so

593
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,841
all the distances
increase, then the theorem

594
00:30:38,841 --> 00:30:40,840
is, if those four disks
didn't intersect before,

595
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,700
they still won't intersect.

596
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,470
Therefore, the lenses
don't hit each other ever,

597
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,250
even when you can pick things
up and drop them back down.

598
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,800
Done.

599
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,990
That covers what we need.

600
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,170
Now, I didn't
prove this theorem.

601
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,145
I don't think it's
too hard, but it's not

602
00:30:57,145 --> 00:30:59,395
folding related so I'm just
going to take it as given.

603
00:30:59,395 --> 00:31:06,190

604
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:08,440
But that was just
one special case.

605
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,905
That's when we had lenses
instead of half-lenses.

606
00:31:10,905 --> 00:31:14,490
In reality we have
half-lenses so there's

607
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,710
a little bit more work to do.

608
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:51,640

609
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:57,900
Well, if the slender chain
is going to intersect itself

610
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:01,600
by some expansive motion--- oh,
by the way, the general case,

611
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,670
you need a continuous motion.

612
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,910
It doesn't work anymore when
you do it instantaneously.

613
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:11,670
I have a nasty example here,
sort of an annoying example.

614
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,330
Suppose you take a bar, and
you take the Reuleaux triangle

615
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:19,730
or just something really big,
and you have another bar here

616
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,680
with no adornment.

617
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,100
And now I instantaneously
move it to the configuration

618
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,400
where I have the same--
this guy didn't move.

619
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:33,070
I just put this guy
here or something.

620
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,840
So if I measure this
distance, it increased

621
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,157
but it's now self-intersecting.

622
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,990
So if you pick things
up and drop them down,

623
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,490
it doesn't work in
the general case.

624
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:44,500
That's because this
wasn't symmetric.

625
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,997
If it was symmetric, then this
guy was already intersecting.

626
00:32:47,997 --> 00:32:50,330
But we can nonetheless prove
for the case we care about,

627
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,850
which is continuous
motion-- because we

628
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:56,030
know there's a continuous
expensive motion-- we can still

629
00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:00,230
prove that no two
half-lenses will intersect.

630
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,430
So now I worry about two
half-lenses intersecting.

631
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:09,930
A half-lens looks
something like this.

632
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,213
Sorry, that's a lens.

633
00:33:11,213 --> 00:33:14,390
A half-lens looks like that.

634
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,910
It has three sides, in general.

635
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,680
This one's bounded
by a disk, this one's

636
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:25,450
bounded by a disk, this one's
bounded by a base segment.

637
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:28,140
So there's basically a bunch
of cases you could worry about.

638
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:33,850
You could worry about
two of these guys hitting

639
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:37,620
in the curvy parts,
so that's case one.

640
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,400

641
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,390
That we get-- what
did I call them?

642
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,435
The base.

643
00:33:46,435 --> 00:33:49,012

644
00:33:49,012 --> 00:33:50,470
I'm going to rename
this, because I

645
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,790
don't like the terminology
I'm using here.

646
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:57,920
Curvy, curvy.

647
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,310
There's the two straight sides,
and there's the two of each,

648
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,140
and there's the
four curvy sides.

649
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:09,290
Suppose they hit on
a curvy side of both?

650
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,280
Well, if they hit on
the curvy side of both,

651
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,540
this is a convex region.

652
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:17,620
I could actually just put back
the rest of the half-lens here

653
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,560
and the rest and
a half-lens here.

654
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,590
They still won't intersect,
because the bases are pointing

655
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:25,540
away from the intersection.

656
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:29,699
So this is actually covered
by the case we just did.

657
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:32,830
We know that if we can complete
it to a lens and still not have

658
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:35,020
intersection-- maybe it
intersects other parts,

659
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,460
but we know these guys
cannot intersect each other

660
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,670
because these entire lenses
couldn't intersect each other.

661
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:45,909
So case one's done.

662
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:49,420
Case two is about is easy.

663
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,495
It could be we have curvy
part meeting a base.

664
00:34:53,495 --> 00:34:56,190

665
00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:02,240
So we have this example
again, but now we

666
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,520
try to intersect with the
base of some other half-lens.

667
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,330

668
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,625
What should I do here?

669
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:19,640

670
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,960
Anything useful I can do?

671
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,460
Yeah?

672
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,432
AUDIENCE: Think about
the points on that line

673
00:35:23,432 --> 00:35:27,870
as they should be expansive.

674
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:31,958
PROFESSOR: Yeah, these points
are expansive from here.

675
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:33,850
AUDIENCE: Tiny, tiny lenses.

676
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,990
PROFESSOR: Tiny
lenses, good, good.

677
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:36,970
Screw this lens.

678
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,530

679
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,040
Yeah I mean, that
lens really does not

680
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,910
participate in this
intersection, right?

681
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:46,400
Think of this as if there
is no adornment there,

682
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,040
which is like you have lots
of tiny half-lenses there,

683
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,100
but there's just none.

684
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,810
It's an empty union of lenses.

685
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,060
This is obviously a
slender adornment.

686
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,180
There's no adornment.

687
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,140
If the original is
going to intersect,

688
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,920
this should also intersect.

689
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,442
And this one I can
actually extend and make it

690
00:36:04,442 --> 00:36:06,650
a full lens, because I'm
intersecting on the top side

691
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,150
here.

692
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,640
These can't hit each
other by convexity.

693
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,630
Great, so this is a symmetric
lens, this is a lens,

694
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,780
this is a lens, symmetric case.

695
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:24,060
So we already know those guys
can't intersect each other.

696
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,950
We have in some a-- there
is a tiny lens here,

697
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:31,090
which is from that
circle and that circle.

698
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:34,080
And the point is, the four
circles defining those two

699
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,280
lenses cannot intersect.

700
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,240
So again, we're done
by the symmetric case.

701
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,830

702
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:45,060
The last case is actually,
I guess, the easiest one,

703
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,650
base to base.

704
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:48,190

705
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:51,720
Base to base is like this.

706
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,500
And yeah, there's
some adornments,

707
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,980
but the adornments don't
really play a role.

708
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,730
So you could imagine
erasing them and just

709
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,489
talking about the
tiny things again.

710
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:02,530
But really, this follows
just because the linkage

711
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,240
is expansive.

712
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,340
We already know that the linkage
will not self-intersect itself.

713
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,160
Particularly, this
distance is increasing

714
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,880
and this distance is increasing.

715
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,719
It's got to move away,
so that can't happen.

716
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:14,760
It could actually never
get to the touching point

717
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,885
if it started non-touching.

718
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:18,330

719
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,830
Done.

720
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:23,070
This proves that if you have
a slender adorned chain,

721
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,940
you take an
expansive motion, you

722
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,231
preserve non-self-intersection.

723
00:37:26,231 --> 00:37:32,260

724
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:36,080
If you have an open chain
of slender adornments,

725
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,520
this is great because you can
straighten out your chain--

726
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,130
why don't I draw the picture.

727
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:49,300

728
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,310
If you want to
get from one shape

729
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:55,430
to some other drawing
of that same polyline,

730
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,180
pretend the links are
the same and pretend

731
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,471
there's all these slender
adornments that are the same,

732
00:37:59,471 --> 00:38:05,690
you can straighten out
each one and then just play

733
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:08,290
this motion backwards,
and take this motion

734
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,596
to here, this motion to here.

735
00:38:09,596 --> 00:38:11,470
This is something I call
the FedEx algorithm,

736
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,390
we were talking about
in the problem session,

737
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,806
because the original
idea of FedEx

738
00:38:14,806 --> 00:38:17,460
is you send all packages to
one central FedEx location

739
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,320
then send them out to
where you want to go.

740
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,702
Crazy idea, but it
worked for quite awhile.

741
00:38:22,702 --> 00:38:24,160
It's a little more
complicated now,

742
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,280
but still that spirit is there.

743
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,700
And someone was asking
in the problem session,

744
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,200
well what if you send a package
from one point in California

745
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,610
the your neighbor?

746
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:37,470
I was like, well yeah, then it
goes far away and comes back.

747
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:42,080
But for math, it's no
problem, no energy issue.

748
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,800
So this is great
for open chains.

749
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,130
It does not work for closed
chains, because closed chains,

750
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,172
there's more than one
convex configuration.

751
00:38:49,172 --> 00:38:51,505
I could take that, I could
take something more squashed.

752
00:38:51,505 --> 00:38:54,100

753
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,490
Now normally this is fine.

754
00:38:55,490 --> 00:39:00,081
We haven't proved it, but
for regular closed chains,

755
00:39:00,081 --> 00:39:02,330
you could actually get from
every convex configuration

756
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:03,200
to every other.

757
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,158
Maybe we'll prove that
in the polyhedra section

758
00:39:05,158 --> 00:39:07,930
because it's easy
to prove there.

759
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,620
Believe that, but
once you start adding

760
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,170
adornments it ain't possible.

761
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,220
So for example, if
I take this thing

762
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:19,520
and I add some adornments to
just fill in all the space,

763
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,700
this is not so slender.

764
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,880
But you can even draw it
with it being slender.

765
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,524
There's no way I can
go from here to here.

766
00:39:25,524 --> 00:39:27,690
That's not very convincing,
because there isn't even

767
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,290
a configuration like that.

768
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,740
Here's a more convincing one.

769
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,220
Suppose you have
a parallelogram,

770
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:37,670
and you have a right triangle,
and a right triangle.

771
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:43,836
And now I want to go to here.

772
00:39:43,836 --> 00:39:45,460
If I was allotted
instantaneous motion,

773
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,954
this would be fine,
even be expansive.

774
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:50,120
Well, no it's not expansive.

775
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,220
This distance
increases, and that's

776
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,670
why this theorem doesn't apply.

777
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,470
But these are two
complex configurations.

778
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,900
I can't get from
one to the other.

779
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,601
So for closed chains,
this doesn't quite

780
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:02,350
prove the configuration
space is connected

781
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,433
and you have to worry about
the convex situations.

782
00:40:04,433 --> 00:40:07,980
For open chains, it does.

783
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,770
Open problem, are there
any other adornments

784
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,046
like slender ones?

785
00:40:13,046 --> 00:40:14,420
Or are slender
the most you could

786
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,770
hope for a general result?

787
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:20,400
Is there some shape that is not
slender, such that no matter

788
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,890
how you add them to
a chain you'd still

789
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:29,420
have a theorem like this
that they never lock?

790
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,730
I would guess slender's the
most you could hope for,

791
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,620
but I'm not sure.

792
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:37,070
One special case
we can understand

793
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:40,570
is the case of triangles.

794
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:42,900
We know equilateral
triangles are bad.

795
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,580
We know right
triangles are good.

796
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:49,060
We know obtuse
triangles are good,

797
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,350
because these are slender.

798
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:56,580
What if I take a triangle
that's slightly more than 90,

799
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,070
slightly less than 90 here?

800
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:01,650
I know if I go all the
way to 60, it's bad,

801
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,490
but what about
slightly less than 90?

802
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:06,410

803
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:09,410
Also bad.

804
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,610
That's not convincing yet.

805
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:12,000
This is equilateral triangles.

806
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,290
I've made it more
complicated example

807
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:17,230
here in order to get a couple
of properties, but one of them

808
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:20,530
is that all of the equilateral
triangles are the same size.

809
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,676
It's a little bit cooler.

810
00:41:21,676 --> 00:41:23,300
You have to imagine
where the bars are.

811
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:28,760
There's a bar here, and
a bar here, and so on.

812
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,980
This is what it looks like
when it's self-touching.

813
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,120
And the reason I'm looking
at that is I think,

814
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,410
what if I shear
this whole picture

815
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,120
or scale it non-uniformly in y?

816
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,820
So make it taller.

817
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,400
Taller?

818
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,040
Shorter.

819
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,850
I make it shorter
first in this picture.

820
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,950
I'm going to make it
taller in a second.

821
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:52,080
I've got to correct things,
but all of these triangles now,

822
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,990
the base is along here.

823
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,390
This is the apex angle.

824
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:59,229
So here I made the apex
even smaller than 60,

825
00:41:59,229 --> 00:42:00,770
just not the direction
I cared about.

826
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,460
But the point is,
this thing will

827
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,655
stay locked no matter
how you shear it.

828
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,280
And so here I have
a bunch of triangles

829
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,350
where the apex angles, you can
make them arbitrarily small.

830
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,270
So even if I-- no surprise.

831
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:14,210
If I have a super
pointy triangle,

832
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:17,070
you're going to be able
to lock them like this.

833
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,530
But also if you go
the other way and you

834
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:25,720
make this a kind of
more than 60 angle,

835
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,910
as long as it's less than
90 this will stay locked.

836
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:33,400
And to give you some
intuition, if it's less than 90

837
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,330
I can apply rule one here.

838
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,960

839
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,950
But as soon as that
angle reaches 90,

840
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:47,410
this apex will be 90,
and so then rule one

841
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:49,550
does not apply here.

842
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:52,020
I think it'll still
apply on the other side,

843
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,290
but it doesn't matter.

844
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:57,451
You really need both sides to
be acute for rule one to apply.

845
00:42:57,451 --> 00:42:58,950
This example's
actually a little bit

846
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,020
messy to prove that it's locked.

847
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,900
You can apply the
rules down to here,

848
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,740
but then you're not able
to apply rules anymore.

849
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,100
Actually, you can't even do
it in the last one, I think.

850
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,590
Just up to here, so here
I have a nice acute angle,

851
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,965
here I don't have
an acute angle.

852
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,332
It's kind of annoying.

853
00:43:14,332 --> 00:43:16,790
The best way that I know to
prove that this thing is locked

854
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:20,440
is to compute an
equilibrium stress that's

855
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,520
positive or negative
on all of the struts.

856
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,020
Remember, there's
little struts here

857
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,074
saying that this guy has to
move away from this corner.

858
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:30,490
Or if could slide
along the edges,

859
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,770
but it can't go
on the other side.

860
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:34,580
So you could do that,
it's kind of messy.

861
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:38,614
I will prove to you
a simpler example.

862
00:43:38,614 --> 00:43:40,280
We already did the
first one, but here's

863
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,260
another equilateral
triangle example.

864
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,315
Even fewer triangles,
and also locked.

865
00:43:45,315 --> 00:43:47,920

866
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,720
This one you can't
scale quite as nicely.

867
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:58,300

868
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,800
Actually, I could
give you a choice.

869
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,216
Which proof would
you like to see,

870
00:44:01,216 --> 00:44:03,690
the easy one or the hard one?

871
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:05,650
Easy?

872
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,610
Hard?

873
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:10,290
One person for hard,
thanks Harrison.

874
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:14,970

875
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:16,510
I like easy proofs.

876
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:17,970
They're more exciting.

877
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:20,460
OK, first the hard part is
I have to draw the example.

878
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:35,644

879
00:44:35,644 --> 00:44:37,060
If you want to see
the hard proof,

880
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,143
it's in the lecture notes.

881
00:44:38,143 --> 00:44:41,080
I kept it in there.

882
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,820
This should be the same
as that, more or less.

883
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,049
Imagine self-touching.

884
00:44:46,049 --> 00:44:47,590
We're going to prove
that it's rigid,

885
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:50,890
therefore any perturbation
is strongly locked.

886
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:53,548
What should I do?

887
00:44:53,548 --> 00:44:55,040
AUDIENCE: Apply rules.

888
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,570
PROFESSOR: Apply rules, yes.

889
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,500
I like the rules.

890
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,540
I live by the rules.

891
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,340

892
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:05,200
The first rule of the rules
is don't talk about the rules.

893
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,420
No, we have rule one here.

894
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,980
The first rule of the
rules is apply the rules.

895
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:14,110
So we can apply rule one because
this is acute, this is acute.

896
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:15,640
OK, now I have to redraw.

897
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:25,130

898
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:29,740
I should really have one of
these in the problem set.

899
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,080
Applying rules is so much fun.

900
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,000
It's also easy to make mistakes.

901
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,580
That's a good
problem set question.

902
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,595
All right, these
are not touching.

903
00:45:37,595 --> 00:45:39,925

904
00:45:39,925 --> 00:45:41,800
I mean, I don't really
have to fill these in.

905
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,410
They're triangles, of
course they're rigid.

906
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:46,105
But now these are
fused together.

907
00:45:46,105 --> 00:45:47,510
Can I apply any more rules?

908
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:52,230

909
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:53,220
I think so.

910
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,750
I've got to try
not to cheat here.

911
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:58,640
This looks like a
rule too, right?

912
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,270
This is an acute angle,
so this fused together.

913
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:03,650
I'm just going to redraw that.

914
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:05,370
This fused together.

915
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:05,880
Any others?

916
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:15,072

917
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:17,926
I guess that's it.

918
00:46:17,926 --> 00:46:20,590
Now I've got to do something
other than rules, darn it.

919
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:23,170

920
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:24,290
Life is not so easy.

921
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:31,840

922
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,830
I'm going to look at-- this
is divine inspiration here.

923
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:39,900
Well, co-author
inspiration, I suppose.

924
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:46,900
I'm going to look at that
convex-- 1-2-3-4-5-- pentagon.

925
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,382
It's convex.

926
00:46:48,382 --> 00:46:49,090
OK, not strictly.

927
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:55,670
There's a corner of angle 180.

928
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:58,710
Actually, there's a couple
of ways to prove this.

929
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:02,940
Just look at this
convex arm, open chain

930
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,425
on the edges of
the convex polygon.

931
00:47:04,425 --> 00:47:08,857

932
00:47:08,857 --> 00:47:10,190
What's the right way to do this?

933
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:12,938

934
00:47:12,938 --> 00:47:15,000
I have a better argument.

935
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:25,310
It turns out, if you take a
motion of a convex polygon--

936
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:32,270
any motion must decrease
at least two angles.

937
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:38,390

938
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:39,970
And that's really
hard to do here.

939
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:42,710
You can't decrease this angle,
or this angle, or this angle,

940
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:46,369
of this angle, because you've
got this stuff in the way.

941
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:48,910
There's only one angle you could
maybe decrease, but actually

942
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:51,440
even that one's probably
not going to work.

943
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,880
And I have to decrease two
of them, contradiction.

944
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,370
So there's no motion
of this thing.

945
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:59,210
It's like those tightly
packed convex configurations.

946
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,080
You can't move from
here, just looking

947
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,620
at the inside of this thing.

948
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:05,706
The rest is all been rigidified.

949
00:48:05,706 --> 00:48:10,117
Well, I guess there's one vertex
here, but once this is rigid,

950
00:48:10,117 --> 00:48:11,700
then this triangle
is rigidly attached

951
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,080
to these three triangles.

952
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:18,720
So the whole thing is rigid,
and therefore from last lecture

953
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,880
it's strongly locked.

954
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:25,150

955
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,939
AUDIENCE: The lecture
notes say one angle?

956
00:48:27,939 --> 00:48:29,730
PROFESSOR: The lecture
notes say one angle.

957
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:31,750
I should change it
to two, because I'm

958
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:32,940
more worried about this one.

959
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,220
But two is also true.

960
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:38,380
It also decreases
at least one angle,

961
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:42,860
but in particular
decreases two of them.

962
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,625
Where's the lecture notes?

963
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:52,810

964
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:54,590
So it turns out--
and this is something

965
00:48:54,590 --> 00:49:01,494
we'll prove later, this is
theorem by Koshy, like 1800s.

966
00:49:01,494 --> 00:49:03,785
If you have a convex polygon,
you move it, at least two

967
00:49:03,785 --> 00:49:06,201
of the angles must decrease
and at least two of the angles

968
00:49:06,201 --> 00:49:07,989
must increase.

969
00:49:07,989 --> 00:49:10,530
In fact, well there's all sorts
of cool things you can prove,

970
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,510
but that's slated
for another lecture.

971
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:16,000
We'll see that in the future.

972
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,950
I want to move on to a
different cool topic, which

973
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:22,000
is hinge dissections.

974
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,620
Any questions about locked,
slender, or nonslender

975
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,450
adornments?

976
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:30,410
So for triangles, we
have a tight answer.

977
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:33,360
You need to be right or obtuse.

978
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,960
In general, slender works.

979
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,660
I don't know if other
things work, but guess not.

980
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:46,500

981
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,470
Oh, another open
question, locked squares.

982
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:52,380

983
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:58,842
Now, if you have squares
that are properly aligned--

984
00:49:58,842 --> 00:50:04,145
I don't draw them very well--
so if the base of the square

985
00:50:04,145 --> 00:50:06,670
is through the diagonal
of the square, that's

986
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,910
slender so those can't lock.

987
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:11,890
But if you allow
the base edge to be

988
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:13,750
along the side of
a square like this,

989
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,980
I take unit squares
in the plane.

990
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:19,170
Open question, are these locked?

991
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:21,129
It's probably
really easy, we just

992
00:50:21,129 --> 00:50:22,670
haven't worked hard
enough in proving

993
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:24,810
that these things are locked.

994
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:27,310
So that's something we could
work on in the problem session.

995
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:29,250
These are examples
in this paper.

996
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:31,160
So, we conjecture
these are locked.

997
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,116
So there's some work to do.

998
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:37,422
It's a fun, fun toy question.

999
00:50:37,422 --> 00:50:38,630
All right, hinge dissections.

1000
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:41,360

1001
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:46,230
The idea here is, if you look
at one of these adorned chains

1002
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:49,130
we've been thinking about where
you have solid blocks hinged

1003
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:51,619
together points, and you
think about them moving--

1004
00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:53,160
we've been thinking
about them moving

1005
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,720
and when you can
move from shape a

1006
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,600
to shape b or configuration
a to configuration b.

1007
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,450
But in particular configurations
where they're touching,

1008
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:03,990
you could imagine
erasing those cuts.

1009
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:06,530
On the top I get a square,
and the bottom here I

1010
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:07,980
get an equilateral triangle.

1011
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,460
So we call this a
hinge dissection

1012
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:12,520
from an equilateral
triangle to a square.

1013
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,750
This one goes back
over a century

1014
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:19,600
by this puzzle guy,
Henry Ernest Dudeney.

1015
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,430
A natural question
is, can you do

1016
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:25,600
this for any two polygons
of the same area?

1017
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,190
You have to preserve area,
because unerasing-- fusing cuts

1018
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:32,620
does not change the area.

1019
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:36,200
Natural question,
we've been working

1020
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:41,045
on this question
for about 10 years.

1021
00:51:41,045 --> 00:51:45,450
We started in 1999, and
the first thing we proved

1022
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:46,920
is that you couldn't
do everything,

1023
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:51,380
but if you pixelate
shapes it works.

1024
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,270
So in this case,
we're not pixelating.

1025
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:56,020
We're dividing our
shape into half squares.

1026
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,500
It turns out, if you
take every-- so here I

1027
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,150
have 32 half squares.

1028
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:04,700
In the letter A, I also
have 32 half squares.

1029
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,545
So I want to go from
the square to an A.

1030
00:52:07,545 --> 00:52:10,160
It turns out, if you take
each of these half squares

1031
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:16,030
and replace it by four
smaller half squares,

1032
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:19,890
and I hinge the half squares
in this particular pattern--

1033
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:20,610
you can check it.

1034
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:23,420
It alternates in a
very regular pattern.

1035
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:25,115
It will work that
way in the square,

1036
00:52:25,115 --> 00:52:26,823
it'll also work that
way in the letter A.

1037
00:52:26,823 --> 00:52:28,750
I don't actually know
for sure whether there's

1038
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,760
a continuous motion
between these two

1039
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,840
without self-intersection,
because these are not

1040
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,800
slender adornments the
way I've drawn them.

1041
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,510
But this is a hinge
dissection that

1042
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:45,250
exists in all of these states,
the whole alphabet and numbers.

1043
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,230
And it's just 128 pieces.

1044
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,230
So that would actually
be really fun to animate.

1045
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:53,380
I haven't tried to do that yet.

1046
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,630
You can generalize that
to three dimensions.

1047
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,890
I think I showed
this in lecture one.

1048
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:00,100
Here we have solid blocks.

1049
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:03,360
So this is like pixelating,
but it's just stretched.

1050
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:07,540
And we have piano hinges,
about 1,000 blocks here,

1051
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:10,120
and you can pick up your
gloves and reconfigure

1052
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,490
the sculpture into
whatever shape you want.

1053
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:15,620
The theorem is, you can make
it into any polycube, any shape

1054
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:22,140
made out of-- not 1,000,
but 250 for 125, I guess.

1055
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:28,300
You divide by 8 to make a 2 by 2
by 2 larger square, or a larger

1056
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,270
cube.

1057
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:31,710
It's a stretched
cube, but same thing.

1058
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:35,832
And then you can make any
shape made out of those shapes.

1059
00:53:35,832 --> 00:53:36,790
That was the beginning.

1060
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:38,414
This is not everything,
it's everything

1061
00:53:38,414 --> 00:53:42,290
up to some resolution, but we
would really like everything.

1062
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:45,769

1063
00:53:45,769 --> 00:53:49,052
And in this class
three years ago,

1064
00:53:49,052 --> 00:53:50,510
we proved to you
can make anything.

1065
00:53:50,510 --> 00:54:10,869

1066
00:54:10,869 --> 00:54:13,160
I think I posed this question
in the very first problem

1067
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:17,520
session three years
ago, thinking maybe we

1068
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,800
can prove some special
cases, something interesting.

1069
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,290
And then two or three
problem sessions

1070
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:28,610
later, it started
to collapse and get

1071
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:32,572
solved, which is super
exciting given that we've

1072
00:54:32,572 --> 00:54:34,155
been thinking about
this for 10 years.

1073
00:54:34,155 --> 00:55:17,200

1074
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,600
So this is going to be a little
more general than two polygons.

1075
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,920
And suggested by the
alphabet, there's

1076
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,510
one hinge dissection
that can fold

1077
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:27,930
into many different
shapes, not just two.

1078
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:33,410
So you take any finite set
of polygons of the same area,

1079
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:36,240
then there's one chain of
polygons hinged together

1080
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,610
at points that can continuously
fold into all of those things

1081
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:42,395
without self-intersection.

1082
00:55:42,395 --> 00:55:43,770
Now, how do you
think we're going

1083
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:46,150
to avoid self-intersection?

1084
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:47,330
Slender.

1085
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:49,370
We've got this
great tool lined up

1086
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:52,910
for proving the continuously
part of this theorem.

1087
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:55,720
The other part requires
totally new ideas,

1088
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,010
but continuously is
going to be easy,

1089
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:01,450
because the name
of the game here

1090
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:04,590
is we're given polygons
we want to make,

1091
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:06,320
but we can make
them out of a chain

1092
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,820
of arbitrarily many pieces.

1093
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,510
So if we have some
change that is working

1094
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:13,750
without the continuity,
we can cut those pieces

1095
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,590
into smaller parts
until they're slender.

1096
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:17,810
It turns out that's
going to be easy.

1097
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:21,620

1098
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,730
I'll come back to that.

1099
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:34,910

1100
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:38,050
The hard part is to do this
with ignoring continuous motion.

1101
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:41,640

1102
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,370
So there's this crazy idea.

1103
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:46,622
It comes from Zack Abel who
is attending the problem

1104
00:56:46,622 --> 00:56:48,580
sessions this year, so
a bunch of you know him.

1105
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:58,530

1106
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:00,420
I guess number two
is the crazy idea.

1107
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:09,690

1108
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:11,350
Hinge dissections
are actually named

1109
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:14,246
after something else
called dissections.

1110
00:57:14,246 --> 00:57:16,620
With dissections, you don't
care about hinging the pieces

1111
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:17,360
together.

1112
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,380
I take one shape,
I cut it into a lot

1113
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:21,230
of parts-- that's
the dissecting.

1114
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:24,710
I rearrange the parts however
I want-- rigid motions--

1115
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:28,520
and then fuse together the
edges and I get another shape.

1116
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,040
So there's no hinging
here, there's no folding.

1117
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,750
And it's well known
since the 1800s

1118
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,000
that dissections always exist.

1119
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,820

1120
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:40,260
I can give you a quick
idea of how that's proved.

1121
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:44,300
You take some polygon and some
other polygon of equal area.

1122
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:48,550

1123
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:50,887
Just triangulate
both the polygons

1124
00:57:50,887 --> 00:57:52,470
because that always
makes life easier.

1125
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:57,270

1126
00:57:57,270 --> 00:58:00,980
Still nothing's really
matching between these two.

1127
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:04,450
If you take a
triangle, if you just

1128
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:10,400
cut halfway up from the
base and then cut here,

1129
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,960
you can even do this hinged.

1130
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:17,400
You flip this around,
and flip this around,

1131
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:21,460
you get a rectangle of half
the height of the triangle.

1132
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:24,030
This is how you compute the
area of a triangle, right?

1133
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:24,926
Very easy.

1134
00:58:24,926 --> 00:58:26,550
So do that for each
of these triangles.

1135
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:29,520
Just cut them so
they make rectangles.

1136
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,490

1137
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:34,590
Do that here, do that here.

1138
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:37,099
What you'll be left with is a
whole bunch of rectangles here

1139
00:58:37,099 --> 00:58:38,640
and a whole bunch
of rectangles here.

1140
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,650
Still kind of a mess.

1141
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,120
But there's this
crazy dissection--

1142
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,732
which I won't be
able to draw, and I

1143
00:58:43,732 --> 00:58:48,830
didn't bring a picture of
it-- that you can basically

1144
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:51,590
take a rectangle of
some height and make

1145
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:54,340
it a rectangle of
some other height.

1146
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:58,764
It's got to preserve area, so
maybe look something like that.

1147
00:58:58,764 --> 00:59:00,430
There is a dissection
from here to here.

1148
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:02,250
It's not hinged,
but you can do it.

1149
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:07,760

1150
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:12,780
Believe me, this goes back
three centuries, or something.

1151
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:15,770
Once you can do that, you can
take your pile of rectangles

1152
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:18,830
here and just change them
all to have the same height.

1153
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:22,490
It's got to be smaller, maybe,
than your original height.

1154
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:25,260
But you just pick some
epsilon and make a whole bunch

1155
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,570
of rectangles of epsilon height.

1156
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:29,800
If you turn this into a
rectangle of height epsilon,

1157
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,420
this into a rectangle
of height epsilon, each

1158
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:33,050
of these into a rectangle
of height epsilon,

1159
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:34,620
and then string
them together, you

1160
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:39,000
get a super long rectangle
of height epsilon.

1161
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,500
If you do the same
thing over here,

1162
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,640
you will also get a
super long rectangle

1163
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,760
of height epsilon
of the same length,

1164
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,350
because they have the
same area overall.

1165
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:50,530
So I can dissect this
into the rectangle,

1166
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:53,890
I can dissect this into the
rectangle, now I just FedEx it.

1167
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:56,846
Except here FedExing means
I take the cut pattern here,

1168
00:59:56,846 --> 00:59:58,220
I overlay it with
the cut pattern

1169
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,690
on the other which could
square the number of pieces.

1170
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:04,050
Tons of pieces in this
thing, but it works.

1171
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:06,100
And you can get from any
polygon to any polygon

1172
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,400
using those gadgets.

1173
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,400

1174
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,850
What I want to focus
on is the hinging.

1175
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:19,830
Hinging is where the
action is for us folders.

1176
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:25,130
And this was the open
problem for a long time.

1177
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:28,310
The crazy idea is,
hinge arbitrarily.

1178
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:34,601

1179
01:00:34,601 --> 01:00:35,600
Oh, that was two shapes.

1180
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,730
If you want k shapes,
you just overlay

1181
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:39,501
k of those cut patterns.

1182
01:00:39,501 --> 01:00:41,000
You'll get some
collection of pieces

1183
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,240
that can be reassembled
into your desired polygons,

1184
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,530
your target polygons here.

1185
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:51,370
Of course, not by hinging,
and definitely not

1186
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:52,770
by hinging arbitrarily.

1187
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:55,620
Like you pick a piece, you hinge
it to any other piece you want.

1188
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:57,036
I don't care which
piece, you just

1189
01:00:57,036 --> 01:00:58,990
keep hinging all
these pieces together.

1190
01:00:58,990 --> 01:00:59,800
It's insane.

1191
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,550
How could this possibly work?

1192
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:04,430
Well, by steps three and four.

1193
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:07,430
Only two steps to go.

1194
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:08,700
This is the crazy idea.

1195
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,780
For a long time we tried
to mimic this proof

1196
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:12,680
but make all the
steps hingeable.

1197
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,710
What's hard about that is,
even if one step is hingeable,

1198
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:17,780
like the triangle
to a rectangle,

1199
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:19,790
you can't really
combine two hingeings.

1200
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:20,941
You can't FedEx.

1201
01:01:20,941 --> 01:01:22,690
You can't do one thing
and then the other.

1202
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:25,250
You don't have transitivity,
because one hinging may not

1203
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:28,180
be compatible with
the next hinging.

1204
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:32,440
So instead of trying to make
it all work hinged all the way,

1205
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:37,270
we just let it not
work and then fix it.

1206
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:39,720
Great idea.

1207
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,780
The way we're going to
fix it is by subdividing

1208
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:46,435
the pieces, which will mean
we have to add more hinges.

1209
01:01:46,435 --> 01:01:53,850

1210
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:57,640
And step three is, do
this to make it work.

1211
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:01,280

1212
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,920
So in some sense we know how
we want to assemble the pieces.

1213
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,490
That's what the
dissection tells us,

1214
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:07,740
that's what step one tells us.

1215
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,570
That if you arrange
the pieces like this,

1216
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:12,440
it'll give you the
polygon you want.

1217
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:15,522
Somehow I want to make each
of those assemblies valid.

1218
01:02:15,522 --> 01:02:16,980
I'm going to do
that one at a time.

1219
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,396
I'm going to enable
the first one,

1220
01:02:18,396 --> 01:02:20,294
then enable the
second one, and so on.

1221
01:02:20,294 --> 01:02:21,710
I could actually
get one for free.

1222
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:23,140
Instead of hinging
arbitrarily, I

1223
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:26,270
could hinge to make
the first one right.

1224
01:02:26,270 --> 01:02:29,020
I just draw it as they are, and
then just somehow add hinges

1225
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:30,304
to connect it all together.

1226
01:02:30,304 --> 01:02:31,720
But I won't even
worry about that.

1227
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,145
I'll just make it
work for the first one

1228
01:02:33,145 --> 01:02:34,090
and make it work
for the second one.

1229
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:35,506
This is not going
to be efficient,

1230
01:02:35,506 --> 01:02:37,640
I should mention that.

1231
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:41,030
Not particularly efficient.

1232
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:43,500
The fourth step is,
make it slender.

1233
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:47,090
And we're going to use the
same trick of subdividing,

1234
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:50,926
and that will solve that.

1235
01:02:50,926 --> 01:02:52,630
I haven't said much yet.

1236
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:56,770

1237
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:57,800
Just now we have a plan.

1238
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:02,200

1239
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:06,990
We need some gadgets, and
here's where I get way

1240
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:09,286
beyond the pictures I
could draw on the board.

1241
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:11,660
This I could draw on the board,
but the picture to come I

1242
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:13,000
could not.

1243
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,420
So here's a general picture.

1244
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:19,250
Let's say we have some
hinging in some arrangement.

1245
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,480
We really want it
to be different,

1246
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,779
so we're committed to
having a hinge here

1247
01:03:23,779 --> 01:03:25,320
and committed to
having a hinge here.

1248
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,870
We can never remove
hinges, otherwise

1249
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:28,940
we'll break previous
constructions.

1250
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:32,400
But what I can do is cut up
the pieces and add more hinges.

1251
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,100
As long as it can
still fold this way,

1252
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:36,770
I can still make everything
I could make before.

1253
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:39,054
I just also want it to be
able to fold into this.

1254
01:03:39,054 --> 01:03:40,470
This does not look
like a folding.

1255
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:45,190
Here I'm detaching
the green thing from B

1256
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:46,990
and reattaching it to
B prime on the top.

1257
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,615
So I just shifted
the orange thing down

1258
01:03:48,615 --> 01:03:51,920
and reattached the green
at B prime instead of B,

1259
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:56,780
at the same vertex A.
This is not everything

1260
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:58,460
I need, but this will
be really useful.

1261
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:01,100
If I could do this, I'll
be able to do everything

1262
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:02,640
in a couple steps.

1263
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,345
So let me show you
how to do this.

1264
01:04:04,345 --> 01:04:04,845
Watch.

1265
01:04:04,845 --> 01:04:08,290

1266
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:11,750
So this is dissection.

1267
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:18,100
We're going to cut out a lot
of little isosceles triangles

1268
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:20,250
in pairs here.

1269
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:23,060
It's basically
slicing up this angle.

1270
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:26,640
So here, two pairs are
still in, and two pairs

1271
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,880
have just been folded out.

1272
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,360
And then we're
also-- so remember we

1273
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,310
want it to go from
here to up there.

1274
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:37,950
So we're also going to cut
matching little triangles

1275
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:42,900
along the edges, along some
path that goes from this vertex

1276
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:43,990
to that vertex.

1277
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:47,180
There's always some
outside path I can follow,

1278
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,010
and so I'm going to cut.

1279
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:55,890
Now, the way we do it, we're
making very shallow triangles

1280
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:57,900
here.

1281
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:00,212
I want to make them match
the triangles that I'm

1282
01:05:00,212 --> 01:05:01,420
going to be cutting out here.

1283
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:03,240
So it's got to be
an even number.

1284
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,950
I just want to
divide up that edge

1285
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:08,650
into an even number
of tiny pieces.

1286
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:11,140
And then these two match the
size of those two pieces,

1287
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,170
and these two match
the size of those two,

1288
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:16,940
so that in particular I could
not touch anything, leave it

1289
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:22,200
the way it used to be, and I
have exactly the old picture.

1290
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:25,130
But alternatively-- and
so it hinges all the ways

1291
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:26,960
it used to be able to hinge.

1292
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,560
But alternatively, I can
take these pieces out

1293
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,464
and rearrange them like this.

1294
01:05:33,464 --> 01:05:34,880
So the pieces are
colored the same

1295
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,270
as they were before, except
now instead of putting

1296
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:39,450
these green pieces
in here, I put

1297
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:44,120
the green pieces along
the boundary here.

1298
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,320
And we designed them
to fit perfectly.

1299
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,960
So these two came from here.

1300
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,910
These two came from here,
these two came from there,

1301
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:54,320
these two came from there.

1302
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:57,250
And if you think about
it, then the green piece

1303
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:01,240
has reached around and
can now touch there.

1304
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:02,714
We still have these
orange pieces.

1305
01:06:02,714 --> 01:06:04,630
They don't have their
holes to go into before,

1306
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:07,075
but conveniently there
are holes right there.

1307
01:06:07,075 --> 01:06:09,200
And that orange chain is
attached right at the top,

1308
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:12,446
right where it needs to be,
so you just stuff them in.

1309
01:06:12,446 --> 01:06:13,820
Never mind how
you stuff them in.

1310
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:16,260
We don't have to worry
about continuous motion yet,

1311
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:18,970
that will come later.

1312
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:21,710
And there you go.

1313
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:24,910
So we've moved this
green piece up to there,

1314
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:29,230
and it had to attach it the
same vertex of the green piece.

1315
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:31,990
Now, that's not
quite what I want.

1316
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:34,860
What I'd really like to be
able to do is take a piece

1317
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:39,030
and move it anywhere I want, and
attach it at a different vertex

1318
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:39,965
than from before.

1319
01:06:39,965 --> 01:06:41,340
Because in general,
I've just got

1320
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:42,780
to put that green
piece somewhere.

1321
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:44,460
And it's touching
somebody, because I

1322
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:46,890
want to make a
connected polygon.

1323
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:50,290
But it might not want to
attach it at the same vertex.

1324
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:52,330
I might need to turn
it around and attach it

1325
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:53,250
to some other vertex.

1326
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:59,670
It turns out, you just do this
twice and you can fix that.

1327
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:02,970
So this is the
elaboration on step three,

1328
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:07,750
and in general we're
going to maintain

1329
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:12,320
at all times the pieces are
connected together in a tree.

1330
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:18,590
Ultimately, I want an open
chain of hinged polygons.

1331
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:21,560
But I'll worry about
that at the end.

1332
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:24,340
For now, let's take
it to be a tree.

1333
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:26,590
So far it looks like
a chain, but easier

1334
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:29,630
to think about a tree.

1335
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:33,470
And then the key thing
that we are able to do,

1336
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:35,580
what this picture
almost proves--

1337
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:38,700
there's another issue
which I'll get to--

1338
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:51,720
is the ability to effectively
move a rooted subtree

1339
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:59,105
to attach at another
hinge at any other vertex.

1340
01:07:59,105 --> 01:08:05,730

1341
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:07,720
What I've drawn here is
we're moving one piece.

1342
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,719
But of course, if there
are more pieces attached

1343
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:11,490
to the green thing,
they could come along

1344
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:13,532
for the ride, no problem.

1345
01:08:13,532 --> 01:08:15,740
So in computer science we
call that a rooted subtree.

1346
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:17,859
So you have some
collection of pieces,

1347
01:08:17,859 --> 01:08:21,609
you have some tree of
pieces hanging off.

1348
01:08:21,609 --> 01:08:23,688
Basically if we deleted
this vertex in a tree,

1349
01:08:23,688 --> 01:08:24,979
it would detach into two parts.

1350
01:08:24,979 --> 01:08:28,420
So here's part A,
here's part B. And maybe

1351
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:30,229
I should actually
give these names.

1352
01:08:30,229 --> 01:08:35,685
So here, this is A, this
is B. Here is little a,

1353
01:08:35,685 --> 01:08:38,120
and here's little b.

1354
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:41,196
And what I can do is pick
some other point, A prime.

1355
01:08:41,196 --> 01:08:42,529
This is a whole bunch of pieces.

1356
01:08:42,529 --> 01:08:45,350
I can pick any vertex
of any piece in A,

1357
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:47,550
and I can move B over to there.

1358
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:48,920
I'll just redraw it here.

1359
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,540

1360
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:53,689
Here's the old vertex, little a.

1361
01:08:53,689 --> 01:08:57,470
Here's the new vertex,
little a prime.

1362
01:08:57,470 --> 01:09:00,880
And I can attach the
triangle to be there,

1363
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:05,470
but it still had to attach
at the same root, little b.

1364
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:07,500
What I'd really
like to do, suppose

1365
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,660
I have some other
vertex here, B prime,

1366
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:14,025
I'd really like to make B
prime attach to A prime.

1367
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:17,529

1368
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:19,819
This is step one.

1369
01:09:19,819 --> 01:09:24,270
Step two is to do
the same thing,

1370
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:26,269
but with the roles
of A and B reversed.

1371
01:09:26,269 --> 01:09:27,310
This is a rooted subtree.

1372
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:29,674
It's everything at
this root and below.

1373
01:09:29,674 --> 01:09:31,090
But this is also
a rooted subtree.

1374
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:33,910
It's everything at
this root and above.

1375
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:35,622
So I'm going to take
this thing, think

1376
01:09:35,622 --> 01:09:37,080
of it as a rooted
subtree, and say,

1377
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,040
well I'd like to move
this rooted subtree

1378
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,630
to attach at B prime
instead of B. It's exactly

1379
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:44,399
the same operation,
just reversing roles.

1380
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:50,050
Then I will have B
with vertex little b,

1381
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:52,310
vertex little b prime.

1382
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:58,490
And I have my blob A,
where this is A prime

1383
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:10,050
and this is little a,
just rotating pieces.

1384
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:15,780
So look, I've now accomplished
these two chunks of pieces

1385
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:22,140
I've been able to move
subtree b instead of attaching

1386
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:27,450
at little a to little b, it now
attaches at A prime B prime.

1387
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:29,700
This really means I can
take any piece I want--

1388
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:32,970
you can think of B as just
being a single piece, in fact,

1389
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:34,976
but I need this operation
to work for subtrees.

1390
01:10:34,976 --> 01:10:36,600
I take a single piece,
I say, well it's

1391
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,470
currently attached at this
vertex to this vertex,

1392
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:41,560
but I really want
something else.

1393
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,790
I want some other
vertex of B to attach

1394
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:46,930
to some other vertex
of any other piece.

1395
01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:48,820
And this will let me do that.

1396
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:50,945
I pick the vertex I
want to attach to,

1397
01:10:50,945 --> 01:10:53,180
I pick the vertex I
want to attach from.

1398
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:56,550
I do two of these rooted
subtree moves-- these things--

1399
01:10:56,550 --> 01:11:01,040
and then I achieve moving
this piece to anywhere I want.

1400
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:01,989
Question?

1401
01:11:01,989 --> 01:11:03,739
AUDIENCE: So it seems
like you're using up

1402
01:11:03,739 --> 01:11:06,470
perimeter when you
do each one of these.

1403
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:07,095
PROFESSOR: Yeah

1404
01:11:07,095 --> 01:11:08,636
AUDIENCE: So what
happens if you need

1405
01:11:08,636 --> 01:11:10,770
to use the same [INAUDIBLE].

1406
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:13,750
PROFESSOR: So the question
is, I'm using up perimeter.

1407
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:15,000
What if I had to use it again?

1408
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,720
Because I'm following
one of these long paths,

1409
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:21,297
slicing up pieces like
crazy, and now there

1410
01:11:21,297 --> 01:11:23,380
may be some other piece
that was attached to green

1411
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:24,570
and I want to move
it somewhere else.

1412
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:26,710
It might have to follow
along this path again.

1413
01:11:26,710 --> 01:11:29,657
And indeed, I will.

1414
01:11:29,657 --> 01:11:31,490
You can be smart about
it, or you could say,

1415
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:33,710
well it'll kind of work.

1416
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:38,320
It's just now-- just
think about this picture

1417
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,510
and you follow some path.

1418
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:42,650
There's now just more
pieces you visit.

1419
01:11:42,650 --> 01:11:45,152
So there's still an outer
boundary to these pieces.

1420
01:11:45,152 --> 01:11:47,360
I'm going to think of them
still being in this state,

1421
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,330
not in this state.

1422
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:50,154
I can fix it to be
whatever I want.

1423
01:11:50,154 --> 01:11:52,570
So I'm going to end up cutting
this into little triangles,

1424
01:11:52,570 --> 01:11:54,786
and little triangles,
little triangles.

1425
01:11:54,786 --> 01:11:56,660
It's going to get really
messy, really quick.

1426
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:58,740
Every time I do one
of these operations,

1427
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:02,440
I potentially double the
number of pieces or worse.

1428
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:05,000
So this going to be an
exponential number of pieces

1429
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,130
if I'm not careful.

1430
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:08,460
You can be careful and
do a little bit better,

1431
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:12,370
but you cannot hope for
a bound in terms of n--

1432
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:15,360
like I would hope for n to
some polynomial in n number

1433
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,150
of pieces.

1434
01:12:16,150 --> 01:12:18,850
That's not possible,
even for dissections.

1435
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:22,860
If I have a nice, fat
rectangle and I just say,

1436
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:28,560
I want to make it into a
super narrow, skinny rectangle

1437
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,480
of the same size,
same area, that's

1438
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:35,890
going to require a lot of
cuts even though n is 4.

1439
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:37,710
So I can't hope for
a polynomial bound.

1440
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:39,640
You can actually get a
pseudo polynomial bound

1441
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:43,210
in a certain sense, but I
don't want to get into that,.

1442
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:46,680
Let's go for existence.

1443
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,140
So that was a good question.

1444
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:50,350
We're going to use this
perimeter over and over.

1445
01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:52,808
There's unfortunately another
issue with this construction.

1446
01:12:52,808 --> 01:13:00,480
This is not enough, because
here I basically assumed

1447
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:03,990
that this green piece was
one solid piece attached

1448
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:07,320
at one point to the orange.

1449
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,290
As soon as I do this
operation, there's

1450
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:15,450
now a whole bunch of
pieces here at this vertex.

1451
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:18,130
have to do a more general thing.

1452
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:19,560
This is where it get's messy.

1453
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:20,030
AUDIENCE: [WHISTLES]

1454
01:13:20,030 --> 01:13:20,821
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

1455
01:13:20,821 --> 01:13:23,040

1456
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:26,950
In general, I might
have several hinges

1457
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:28,540
connecting several
pieces over here

1458
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:29,890
to several pieces over there.

1459
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:32,265
Pieces that don't have hinges
I don't care so much about,

1460
01:13:32,265 --> 01:13:36,330
but I have to worry about
this in the general case.

1461
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:38,390
It is messier.

1462
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:39,810
So this is the input.

1463
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:43,310
Our goal is to attach these
three pieces, because this

1464
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:45,350
is like a rooted subtree here.

1465
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:47,690
Initially, this may have
just been one piece,

1466
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:49,916
but it's going to get
cut up pretty quickly.

1467
01:13:49,916 --> 01:13:51,290
So I've got to
deal with the case

1468
01:13:51,290 --> 01:13:53,040
that there are these three
pieces simulating one.

1469
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,623
Maybe there's other
stuff hanging off,

1470
01:13:54,623 --> 01:13:55,595
that's not a big deal.

1471
01:13:55,595 --> 01:14:00,280
And I need to move this entire
bulk hinge somewhere else.

1472
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:01,360
Where are we going?

1473
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,240
It looks like the top.

1474
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,920
Yeah, little b prime.

1475
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:09,060
So here we're attached to B,
we want to attach to b prime.

1476
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:12,190
It can be done.

1477
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:15,320
It's a little trickier, because
more things have to match up.

1478
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,270
So again, we're
going to slice out

1479
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:20,410
from the corner of green,
the corner of purple,

1480
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:22,040
the corner of yellow.

1481
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:25,150
But our pieces are going
to look a little different.

1482
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:27,640
So for green, the
first piece will still

1483
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:28,820
make just skinny triangles.

1484
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:31,410
You can barely see them,
but they are triangles.

1485
01:14:31,410 --> 01:14:35,080
And they're again trying to
match the edge lengths over

1486
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:35,880
here.

1487
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:39,386
So we're walking along the
path, same path as before.

1488
01:14:39,386 --> 01:14:41,260
So we just cut up a
bunch of skinny triangles

1489
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:42,790
to make that work.

1490
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:46,700
But purple one, it's
not going to work

1491
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:48,200
if we just did that
for all of them.

1492
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:50,259
There just aren't enough
slots to put things,

1493
01:14:50,259 --> 01:14:52,550
because really you want to
traverse that boundary three

1494
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:53,647
times.

1495
01:14:53,647 --> 01:14:55,480
And here you can't just
do it one at a time.

1496
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:59,330
I won't work, you'll
get an infinite loop.

1497
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:02,070
So what we do is, each of
the little triangles that

1498
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:05,020
would have come out of here we
actually split into two parts.

1499
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:07,020
It may be easiest to
see on the yellow.

1500
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:08,820
There's a triangle,
and then there's

1501
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:12,800
this non-convex
quadrilateral, a little kite.

1502
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,990
It just fits on top
of the triangle.

1503
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:17,890
If you glue them together,
you get a regular old triangle

1504
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:20,870
and it fits in here
just like before.

1505
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:23,450
But I take that triangle,
I cut it into two parts.

1506
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:26,600
I do that for both
purple and yellow.

1507
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,740
But notice, this
yellow triangle is

1508
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:33,730
bigger than this purple
triangle a little bit.

1509
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:35,390
How much bigger?

1510
01:15:35,390 --> 01:15:39,030
Well, it's designed so
that this yellow triangle

1511
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:42,864
is the same size as these
two pieces put together.

1512
01:15:42,864 --> 01:15:44,280
And this triangle
is the same size

1513
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:47,190
as this piece put
together with itself.

1514
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:49,580
In general, the triangle
at the next level

1515
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:52,350
up will be the same
size as the two

1516
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:57,590
pieces from the previous level,
except here there's only one.

1517
01:15:57,590 --> 01:15:58,600
Why?

1518
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:02,850
Because we want to do
this so that they all fit.

1519
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:06,960
If you take just the quad parts
of everybody and the triangle

1520
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,810
of the last guy, then that
triangle will fit into the quad

1521
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:12,393
of the next one , which will fit
into the quad of the next one

1522
01:16:12,393 --> 01:16:13,520
perfectly.

1523
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,740
Because as far as this
yellow quad is concerned,

1524
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:21,700
that purple plus
green is the same size

1525
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:24,325
as purple plus purple, which
was a regular triangle.

1526
01:16:24,325 --> 01:16:26,200
This triangle is supposed
to be the same size

1527
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,630
as that yellow triangle.

1528
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:30,150
So from the viewpoint
of this yellow quad,

1529
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:32,727
it's just wants
a mate like this,

1530
01:16:32,727 --> 01:16:34,560
which is the same as a
mate like this, which

1531
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:37,260
is the same as a mate like this.

1532
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:40,540
And so those stack in, and
they perfectly fit along.

1533
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:44,550
So the triangles we end up
cutting out of the perimeter

1534
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:48,130
here are the biggest size.

1535
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:49,960
And then you can squeeze
them all together

1536
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:57,700
like this, and boom, you get
your alternate dissection.

1537
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,680
Then the other fun part,
what you're left with

1538
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:04,000
is just the triangles from each
of the colors except the green.

1539
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:12,800
And conveniently, it just works.

1540
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,250
There's a little
more work to do,

1541
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:16,166
because you see there's
also these red pieces.

1542
01:17:16,166 --> 01:17:17,600
Where did those come from?

1543
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,170
Just more stuff.

1544
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:21,955
I see where they came
from, up there at C3.

1545
01:17:21,955 --> 01:17:23,550
A little corner got cut out.

1546
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:26,850
Oh, it's such a mess.

1547
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:29,954
But the idea is, well,
the purple triangles

1548
01:17:29,954 --> 01:17:31,620
are the same size as
the green triangle.

1549
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:36,210
So they can fit in the green
piece and fill in these holes.

1550
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:38,620
And then well, the
yellow triangles

1551
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:42,630
are the same size as the
purple triangles when

1552
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:45,730
you add them together-- that's
what we cut out of here--

1553
01:17:45,730 --> 01:17:49,180
and so the yellow just fits in
there and fills in this space.

1554
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:51,730
And so we just shifted by one.

1555
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:54,990
The trouble is, the yellow guys
we don't quite have enough.

1556
01:17:54,990 --> 01:17:58,310
And for that we cut out
some corner up there just

1557
01:17:58,310 --> 01:18:00,450
to fill them back in.

1558
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:02,670
So you could just stick
the red thing back

1559
01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:04,270
into the red vertex,
nothing changes.

1560
01:18:04,270 --> 01:18:06,940
Or you can take the
red guys, stick them

1561
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:09,900
into the yellow
triangle, and in the end

1562
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:13,100
we successfully move
a rooted subtree

1563
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:16,330
from anywhere to anywhere.

1564
01:18:16,330 --> 01:18:19,780
Lots of things to check
here, but if you stare at it

1565
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:22,530
enough it works.

1566
01:18:22,530 --> 01:18:24,700
And it works for
any value of three.

1567
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,990
Here we were talking about
three pieces, three hinges,

1568
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:29,795
but you can do it for any count.

1569
01:18:29,795 --> 01:18:32,400

1570
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,140
That's the gadget.

1571
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:40,450
And good, we've just enough time
to talk about slenderifying.

1572
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:45,210
So if we do this over
and over, move each piece

1573
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:47,769
to wherever you want, move all
the pieces to where you want

1574
01:18:47,769 --> 01:18:50,060
for target shape, then do it
for the next target shape,

1575
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:51,601
then do it for the
next, you'll still

1576
01:18:51,601 --> 01:18:53,220
be able to go to
all the old foldings

1577
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:55,220
but you can also
go to the new ones.

1578
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:57,770
The last step is
how do we subdivide

1579
01:18:57,770 --> 01:19:00,840
to make our thing slender?

1580
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:02,762
And so we have
some tree hinging.

1581
01:19:02,762 --> 01:19:03,470
It's not a chain.

1582
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:06,009
We want to also make it a
chain and make it slender,

1583
01:19:06,009 --> 01:19:08,300
because slender only works
if it's a chain, not a tree.

1584
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:09,800
So we have some
tree pieces here.

1585
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,372
I've drawn two pieces to
make it a little simpler,

1586
01:19:12,372 --> 01:19:13,830
but this really
works for anything.

1587
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:14,730
It's super simple.

1588
01:19:14,730 --> 01:19:17,630
Triangulate the pieces,
just because triangles

1589
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:19,200
are easier to think about.

1590
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:24,470
Then for each triangle,
cut to its centroid,

1591
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:27,080
where you can fit
the largest disk.

1592
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:30,720
If you do that, each of these
three angles will be obtuse.

1593
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:32,880
So as long as that's
the apex of the triangle

1594
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:36,650
and this is the base--
those are the base edges--

1595
01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:39,600
it will be slender
because it's obtuse.

1596
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,070
Or if might be 90
degrees, maybe.

1597
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:44,700
Maybe not even that.

1598
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,530
I think it's always
strictly obtuse.

1599
01:19:46,530 --> 01:19:48,990
So you do that for
each of the triangles,

1600
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:52,387
and then you just walk
around the outside boundary

1601
01:19:52,387 --> 01:19:54,720
and say, well, just hinge
things together in that order.

1602
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,960
So I'm going to have this
triangle hinge to this one,

1603
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,070
hinge up there around.

1604
01:19:59,070 --> 01:20:01,120
So I just walked around
the outside boundary.

1605
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,870
Now, the key thing to
check is that every hinge

1606
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:06,180
that was here still exists here.

1607
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:08,600
It's still possible
to fold there.

1608
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,660
And we just got more
hinges, no big deal.

1609
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:13,255
Just like before,
the constructions

1610
01:20:13,255 --> 01:20:15,380
we've been doing, we've
been cutting up the pieces,

1611
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:18,066
adding hinges, but preserving
all the old hinges.

1612
01:20:18,066 --> 01:20:19,690
Therefore, any motion
that was possible

1613
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:21,640
before is still possible.

1614
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:27,190
And furthermore, this is now a
slenderly adorned open chain,

1615
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:29,270
we know its configuration
space is connected,

1616
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:30,940
so all those things
that we knew could

1617
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:33,570
exist-- it could be like this
or it could instantaneously

1618
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:35,370
move to here-- now we
know there's actually

1619
01:20:35,370 --> 01:20:38,330
continuous motion from
everywhere everywhere.

1620
01:20:38,330 --> 01:20:39,930
And this kind of
a fun culmination

1621
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:42,310
of all this linkage stuff,
with Carpenter's Rule,

1622
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:45,070
with slender adornments,
all these powerful tools,

1623
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:47,990
we build up universal hinge
dissections, basically

1624
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:51,300
transformers that can
fold from in this case 2D

1625
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:53,040
shape to any other
collection of 2D

1626
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,200
shapes you want of equal area.

1627
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:59,400
And again, you can generalize it
to 3D, although this will work.

1628
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:03,170
Any section you have in
3D will be hingeable,

1629
01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:05,741
but dissections get
a little bit harder.

1630
01:21:05,741 --> 01:21:07,740
You need not just that
the volumes are the same,

1631
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:09,690
but something else
called the [INAUDIBLE]

1632
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:13,550
is the same, which I
don't want to get into.

1633
01:21:13,550 --> 01:21:14,800
That's hinges and dissections.

1634
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,086
Any questions?

1635
01:21:17,086 --> 01:21:21,580
All right, turn in
your problem set.
