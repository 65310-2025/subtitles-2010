0-1:59:59,500 --> 00:00:03,207

2
00:00:03,207 --> 00:00:05,040
PROFESSOR: I'm excited
about today's lecture

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,550
because there's so
many fun topics.

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:12,290
This is like many fun
things all in one lecture.

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:17,290
We're going to start with a
cool little problem, which

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,980
is about unfolding
and re-folding.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,156

8
00:00:25,156 --> 00:00:26,530
You could think
of them-- they're

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,400
kind of like hinged
dissections although they're

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,980
from between surfaces
of polyhedra.

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,480
You can also think of
them as common unfoldings.

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,110

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:48,341
So general idea is,
you have over here

14
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:55,590
in the left team you have
unfoldings-- polygons,

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,140
let's say.

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,072
Possible things that
could fold into polyhedra.

17
00:01:02,072 --> 00:01:04,434
And we'll think convex again.

18
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:07,526

19
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,275
And when we were
thinking about unfolding,

20
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:11,150
we we're thinking about
going this direction.

21
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,730
When we were thinking
about folding,

22
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,350
we were thinking
about this direction.

23
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,220
But what if we do
both repeatedly?

24
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,790
So I start, say, with a cube.

25
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,569
And then I unfold it
and then I re-fold it.

26
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:24,610
That's sort of what the
metamorphosis of the cube

27
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,560
was about.

28
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,643
And then I unfold
that and I re-fold it,

29
00:01:28,643 --> 00:01:31,360
and I unfold and I re-fold
and I unfold and re-fold.

30
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,020
This is a fun tour to take.

31
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,690
Is this space connected?

32
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,030
Can I get from any
polyhedral surface

33
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,080
to any other-- say, convex--
by unfolding and re-folding?

34
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,320
We have no idea.

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,960
So while each of
these operations

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,930
we know a fair amount about--
we know how to generally unfold

37
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,140
convex polyhedra,
we know how to find

38
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,290
all of the gluings of a polygon
into a polyhedron-- repeating

39
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,550
those processes,
we could explore

40
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,620
but actually no ones' every
tried that algorithmically.

41
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,330
It'd be fun to see what
crazy things you get.

42
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,370
But we have lots of examples
and partial progress

43
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,860
towards this question.

44
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,160
So here's the first example.

45
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,040
This appears in the book.

46
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,160
It's by Hirata from 2000.

47
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,210
He was one of the guys who
implemented a gluing algorithm.

48
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:26,130
And this is an unfolding--
a common unfolding--

49
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,620
of a cube-- ah, not quite--
and a regular tetrahedron.

50
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,020
So it's actually
a box not a cube.

51
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,970
One of the big open
questions in this area

52
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,920
is, can you find
a common unfolding

53
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,006
of a perfect cube and a regular
tetrahedron that's open?

54
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:46,380
Marty posed that
question I think

55
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,770
in 1998, in the good old days of
the beginning of folding stuff.

56
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,540
And this is almost an answer
but it's not quite a cube,

57
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,250
as a result.

58
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,208
You could see-- I think
it's pretty easy to see

59
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:02,730
how to fold it into a box just
with extending all the lines.

60
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,490
And the dotted lines
show how to fold

61
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,685
into a regular tetrahedron.

62
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,220

63
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,380
That's one example.

64
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:16,430
You can also fold-- this thing
makes both a regular octahedron

65
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,780
instead of a regular tetrahedron
and some kind of tetrahedra.

66
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,700
It's not regular.

67
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,790
We call it a tetramonohedron,
meaning each of the sides

68
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,430
are the same.

69
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,880
So it's just one type of side,
but there's four of them.

70
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,170
And I guess the red lines
are folding into that,

71
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,710
the green lines fold into
a regular tetrahedron.

72
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,850

73
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,410
I feel like I'm
getting forgetful.

74
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,330
I don't even remember where
this example comes from.

75
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,455
But it's in the book, it's
not attributed to anyone

76
00:03:45,455 --> 00:03:48,810
so I assume Joe invented it.

77
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,310
But recently, like
just this year,

78
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,380
inspired a whole bunch of
examples by these guys.

79
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,870
I just saw the talk
last week in China--

80
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,680
that's where I was traveling,
it was a geometry conference.

81
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,210
And Horiyama and Uehara
talked about a bunch

82
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,530
of different common unfoldings.

83
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,280
This is, again, of
a regular octahedron

84
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,730
and a tetramonohedron.

85
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,530
But a different example.

86
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,540
But they kept going.

87
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,710
Said all right, let's do
all the platonic solids.

88
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:17,490
So this is a common unfolding
of a cube and a tetramonohedron.

89
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,300
Cube-- actually two of them.

90
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,980
You can see how it makes a cube.

91
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,240
That's obvious.

92
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,680
But the tetramonohedron
are the blue lines.

93
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,090
Then I have the octahedron,
we have the icosahedron.

94
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,940
I don't think they
have a dodecahedron yet

95
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,030
because all of these
approaches are actually

96
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,030
based on dissection
techniques where

97
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,830
you take a tiling of-- here
are equilateral triangles

98
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,490
for the icosahedron,
and you take

99
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,110
a tiling of some
triangle that's going

100
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,895
to make the tetramonohedron,
and you align them

101
00:04:49,895 --> 00:04:52,510
so that things work out nicely.

102
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,980
And that's not
always well defined,

103
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,620
but it often leads
to good dissections,

104
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,442
often hinged dissections.

105
00:04:57,442 --> 00:04:58,900
It's the way, for
example, you show

106
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,440
you can hinge
dissect a rectangle

107
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,600
into any other rectangle.

108
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,380
You take tilings of
different rectangles

109
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,620
and overlay them appropriately.

110
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,690
Here, same approach,
but with a dodecahedron,

111
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,400
regular pentagons
don't tile so it's

112
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,610
very hard to use that approach.

113
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,829
So this is as far
as they've gotten.

114
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:16,370
Here they've measured
the proportions

115
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,280
of the tetramonohedron
to give you an idea.

116
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,820
It's close to regular.

117
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,400
But again, open question,
can any two platonic solids--

118
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,600
do any two have a
common unfolding?

119
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,180
They proved in this paper,
if you restrict one of them

120
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,370
to be an edge unfolding
and the other one

121
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,670
can be a general unfolding
then it's not possible.

122
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,380
But if they're both general
unfoldings, who knows.

123
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,670
Here you see it's edge
unfolding for the icosahedron,

124
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,690
but general unfolding
for the other.

125
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,075

126
00:05:46,075 --> 00:05:46,575
Cool.

127
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:49,420

128
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,040
But very recently,
this is, like,

129
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,490
hasn't even been released yet.

130
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:57,340
This is the premier
of the following,

131
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,690
I'll call it conjecture.

132
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,430
I think it's not yet
approved or explicitly-- it's

133
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,680
not certain that it's correct.

134
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,704
But the claim is this gray
shape, taken to the limit--

135
00:06:07,704 --> 00:06:09,620
so this is the first
iteration of the fractal,

136
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,010
this is the second iteration
of the fractal-- in the limit,

137
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:18,540
will fold both to a regular
tetrahedron and a cube.

138
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,250
This would be an
amazing breakthrough.

139
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,330
Still, the conjecture
is that it is not

140
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,070
possible to go from
a regular tetrahedron

141
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,835
to a cube with a regular--
like a normal polygon

142
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:29,600
with a finite number of sides.

143
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,030
But with an infinite number of
sides, it seems to be possible.

144
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,000
Which is awesome.

145
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,820
This is-- I haven't
met this guy yet.

146
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,440
He's a professional puzzler
in Japan, Toshihiro Shirakawa.

147
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,150

148
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:51,980
So stay tuned for maybe a proof
of that theorem, that claim.

149
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,230
The next topic--
this started back

150
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,200
in '99, inspired
by this question.

151
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,740
We thought well,
what about boxes?

152
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,567
And this is a common unfolding
of two different size boxes

153
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:06,150
which is cool.

154
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,540
And it's generated in
a fairly intuitive way.

155
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,190
You start with an
unfolding of a box.

156
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,132
This makes a one
by one by three box

157
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,840
if you think about it
for a little while.

158
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,900
Just wrap around-- this
is like one top side, 1

159
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,880
by 3 rectangle and wrap around.

160
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,740
And then you-- you
draw the gluing-- here

161
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,190
I've labeled which edges
glue to which edges.

162
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,510
And for every letter,
like the two Gs

163
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,750
here, I could imagine adding a
triangle here and removing it

164
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,950
from here.

165
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,900
That will still fold to
the same thing, right?

166
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,290
So I get to choose
for each letter which

167
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,870
guy goes in, which guy goes out.

168
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,580
Then I get this shape as
a result of that process.

169
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,710
And if I do it right,
when I rotate 45 degrees,

170
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,975
I get a different orthogonal
unfolding of some other box.

171
00:07:52,975 --> 00:07:54,850
So here, if I started
with a root 2 by root 2

172
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:59,030
by three root 2 box, I
get a 1 by 2 by 4 box.

173
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,950
So this is a common
unfolding of both.

174
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,180
I guess here is like the
center core of the 1 by 2 by 4

175
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,070
and you wrap around again.

176
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,494
Or this is probably center core.

177
00:08:10,494 --> 00:08:11,410
So that's pretty cool.

178
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,310
This is an idea by Timothy Chan.

179
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,830
Of course, natural
question is, do I

180
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,920
need to do this rotation trick
or could I get away without it?

181
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,560
And you can get away without it.

182
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,750
This is an idea
of Therese Biedl.

183
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,890
This is my Waterloo days.

184
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,750
We had an open problem
session, kind of like the one

185
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,240
we have in this class.

186
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,570
It was the very
first one that I ran.

187
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,870
I ran it with Therese.

188
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,770
And she came up with this idea.

189
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,659
This is a-- it's not obvious
exactly how this works

190
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,331
or where she came up with this.

191
00:08:40,331 --> 00:08:41,289
It was kind of magical.

192
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:44,290
But this the same polygon,
different creases, you

193
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,760
make two different size boxes.

194
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,390
Now they're going to be integers
because they're orthogonal

195
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,410
aligned on the grid.

196
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,170
Pretty cool.

197
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,550
And for a long time, this
was the only example of this

198
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,360
that we had.

199
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,160
There's still an open question
which I give you A by C by-- A

200
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,600
by B by C box and a D by E
by F box, is this possible?

201
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,640
When is this possible?

202
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,970
But at least now--
oh, here's, sorry.

203
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,450
There are two examples.

204
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,450
Of course, the surface
areas have to match.

205
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,950
So the sum of A plus B plus
C equals D plus E plus F.

206
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,965
I think that's right.

207
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:20,694
Or no.

208
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:21,610
It's more complicated.

209
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,510
It's like A times
B plus-- and so on.

210
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,882
Pairwise products.

211
00:09:26,882 --> 00:09:28,340
Now we know that
there are actually

212
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,630
infinitely many examples.

213
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:34,520
This is another fairly
new result by Uehara,

214
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,700
again in 2008.

215
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,530
This is-- Uehara translated
our textbook to Japanese,

216
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,600
by the way.

217
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,840
Another connection.

218
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,840
He does a lot of
fun folding stuff.

219
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,980
Just saw him last week.

220
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,150
So this is an
example of taking a 1

221
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:52,520
by 5 by 2k box and a common
unfolding of that with a 1

222
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,775
by 1 by 6k plus 2 box.

223
00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:58,240
Which has a very
regular pattern.

224
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,320
And this one, little more
complicated to copy and paste

225
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,490
but it makes 1 by 1 by 8k
plus 11 box and a 1 by 3

226
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,540
by 4k plus 5 box.

227
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,314
Which is pretty cool.

228
00:10:09,314 --> 00:10:10,730
I haven't studied
these carefully,

229
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:15,102
but there's two different
ways to fold each.

230
00:10:15,102 --> 00:10:16,560
So now we know
there are infinitely

231
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,850
many of these examples.

232
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,820
It's still not known
when it's possible,

233
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,830
but also in this
paper Uehara came up

234
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,411
with a sort of random
generation algorithm

235
00:10:26,411 --> 00:10:28,160
where he would take a
box, randomly unfold

236
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,030
it, try to fold it
into other boxes.

237
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:36,820
And he has now over 250,000
examples of this process.

238
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,030
And I think these are maybe
inspired by his random search.

239
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,830
I'm not sure, but this
is theory obviously.

240
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,530
One particularly fun
example, this one

241
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,992
actually tiles the plane.

242
00:10:46,992 --> 00:10:48,700
So it'd be efficient
if you're cutting it

243
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,900
out of sheet material.

244
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,820
You can make a common unfolding
of 1 by 2 by 5 box and a 1

245
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,310
by 1 by 8 box.

246
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:59,250
I think this one he
made into a puzzle

247
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,026
with a paper manufacturer.

248
00:11:02,026 --> 00:11:03,390
I'm getting ahead of myself.

249
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,390
Big open question
here that he asked is,

250
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:11,290
are there-- is there a common
unfolding of three boxes?

251
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,270
That remains open.

252
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,330
And he feels like he's
very close to finding one

253
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,070
with his random search
but hasn't yet found one.

254
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,240
It's like it almost
folds into the third box.

255
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,490
But it's strange how
hard it is to find them.

256
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,450
Maybe they don't exist.

257
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,810
That would be surprising.

258
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,930
All right.

259
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:35,070
Next example on this theme,
common unfoldings, is this toy.

260
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:40,450
So this is a 1 by 1 by 4 box,
also known as the-- as a tetra

261
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,480
cubes, four cubes
joined edge to edge.

262
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,980
And-- oh, I should
have practiced.

263
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,660
You can unfold it.

264
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,840
This is a commercially
produced toy.

265
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,430
It's called Cubigami.

266
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,710
And it's one net, one unfolding.

267
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,600
But it can fold into
all tetra cubes.

268
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,060
So that was the tube and, let's
see, what else can I make here?

269
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:13,370

270
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,375
I should have practiced.

271
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:19,570

272
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,340
Interesting.

273
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,340
It's fun.

274
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,050
You can play with it later.

275
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,700
Oh, that looks interesting.

276
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,200
Almost.

277
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,780

278
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,370
Not quite.

279
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,400
It's almost-- it looks
like a Tetris piece, right?

280
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,640
Except I didn't quite
cover it right at the end.

281
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,720
It's a good puzzle.

282
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,430
Obviously.

283
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,330
Maybe if I do it like--
that doesn't work.

284
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,040
Wow.

285
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,540
All right.

286
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,810
You're going to have to
play with it yourself.

287
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,480
I lose.

288
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,470
But you can make all of
the four cube joinings

289
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:06,095
except-- except for this one.

290
00:13:06,095 --> 00:13:08,844

291
00:13:08,844 --> 00:13:10,260
See, the problem
with this example

292
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,930
is it doesn't have the same
surface areas the rest.

293
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,210
And you have to
conserve surface area.

294
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,070
But if you think about
all the other four

295
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:23,740
cubes-- like I was trying to
make this guy or this guy--

296
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:31,080
it's like Tetris
pieces-- but also things

297
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,984
like-- I can draw
better than I can

298
00:13:33,984 --> 00:13:35,150
solve the puzzle apparently.

299
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,830

300
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,500
Like this.

301
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,740
This is the one non-planar one.

302
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,213

303
00:13:45,213 --> 00:13:47,210
All right?

304
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,545
So you've got all the Tetris
pieces except this guy.

305
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:50,820
It's the wrong surface area.

306
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,160
So, in general, it's
all the tree shape ones.

307
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,945
No cycles.

308
00:13:54,945 --> 00:13:55,820
Can make all of them.

309
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:01,370
This is an example found by
Donald Knuth, famous computer

310
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,620
scientist.

311
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,810
He sort of accidentally
at a cocktail party heard

312
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:10,270
about this problem from George
Miller who's a toy designer--

313
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,300
or puzzle designer.

314
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,520
And so then Knuth
went back and he

315
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,510
wrote a program to numerate
all unfoldings of these things

316
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,910
and found there are a whole
bunch of common unfoldings.

317
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,850
But it's found by
exhaustive search.

318
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,250
This was the one that sort of
had the smallest bounding box,

319
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,240
I believe, in terms of area.

320
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,309
And so it's a nice
compact thing.

321
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:32,350
And then there are various
manufacturing's of it.

322
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,140
This is the latest one that's
sort of relatively easy

323
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,260
to build I guess.

324
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:40,160
So, play with that later.

325
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,590
That's four cubes.

326
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,550
What about five cubes?

327
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,420
Well, that was the subject
of a paper also presented

328
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,840
last week in China.

329
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,120
And it turns out, there
is no common unfolding

330
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,270
of all 24 pentacubes.

331
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,040
That's five cubes
joined together.

332
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,780
But there is a common unfolding
of 23 out of 24 of them.

333
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,720
So this is the paper.

334
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,310
There was a bunch of authors.

335
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,530
There were basically
three teams that

336
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,680
worked on this, two of
which were writing code.

337
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,319
I was on one of
the coding teams.

338
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:16,860
And the third one
was trying to think

339
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,870
about the problem
using mathematics.

340
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,305
And for a long time, the
thinkers were leading.

341
00:15:22,305 --> 00:15:24,180
But then, of course,
eventually the computers

342
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,600
win because after a couple days
of just solid computation on I

343
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,500
don't know now how many cores
with each of the groups,

344
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,670
we numerated all
these unfoldings.

345
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:40,070
And so now there's, I think,
over one trillion unfoldings

346
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,820
of the 1 by 1 by 5 tube.

347
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,460
But one trillions not that bad.

348
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,042
Now, we could not
do this for six.

349
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:51,570
But for five it wasn't so bad.

350
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,910
And this is-- there's a bunch
of unfoldings of 23 out of 24.

351
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,650
But that's the max you can get.

352
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,720
Little disappointing.

353
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,615
AUDIENCE: Which pentacube lost?

354
00:15:59,615 --> 00:16:01,490
PROFESSOR: I don't know
which pentacube lost.

355
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,590
I should find out.

356
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,080
That's a good question.

357
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,760
But I do have some
other answers.

358
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,050
So in some sense,
the hard ones I think

359
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,680
are the non-planar guys.

360
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,450
Like this guy.

361
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,680
So they're planar
if all the cubes

362
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,400
lie in a thickened
plane, thickened by one.

363
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,680
This guy will fold into
all the non-planar cubes

364
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,170
and also fold into
most of the pentacubes.

365
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,610
There are only 24 total
so it's only missing two.

366
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,810
And this'll fold into
all the non-planar guys.

367
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,830
And what's cool is
this one is unique.

368
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:35,710
There's only one common
unfolding of those guys.

369
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,522
AUDIENCE: How many
non-planar [INAUDIBLE]?

370
00:16:37,522 --> 00:16:39,230
PROFESSOR: How many
non-planar are there?

371
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,200
I don't remember.

372
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,440
Maybe 10.

373
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,180
I think it's a minority.

374
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,680
But there are still
a bunch of them.

375
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,429
And I think this would
make a good puzzle.

376
00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:51,575
If you're going to
manufacture-- if you guys want

377
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:54,170
to do a start up, here you go.

378
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,320
Freely available.

379
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,300
If you want to do
the planar pentacubes

380
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,930
there are a lot of common
unfoldings of them.

381
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,280
This is one of the
fairly compact ones.

382
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,686
And this one, I have
an animation of.

383
00:17:06,686 --> 00:17:08,060
Or, actually, not
this particular

384
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,630
unfolding, but this concept.

385
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,859
And that is here.

386
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:14,446

387
00:17:14,446 --> 00:17:16,339
Yes, I trust myself.

388
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:19,770
So here is unfolding
and re-folding

389
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,359
of that particular shape.

390
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,349
And then I hit
Space bar and it's

391
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:27,760
the same unfolding but
a different polycube.

392
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,970
And this is going to go
through all of the flat ones.

393
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,430
And that animation is
done heuristically.

394
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:38,020
I don't have any theory
that that's always possible.

395
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,130
But always keeping
the same unfolding,

396
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,486
just changing where
the creases are.

397
00:17:42,486 --> 00:17:43,110
That's so cool.

398
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,916

399
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:47,790
It's funny, actually.

400
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,350
The person who implemented this
was the guy who was thinking,

401
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,840
not the coder-- coder teams.

402
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,010
I guess he had free time.

403
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:58,232

404
00:17:58,232 --> 00:17:59,690
This is by [? Karim ?]
[INAUDIBLE].

405
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,880

406
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,857
I guess you can count them
and then subtract from 24

407
00:18:05,857 --> 00:18:07,940
and you'll get how many
non-planar ones there are.

408
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,650
But I've lost track
of where we are.

409
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,080
Always same unfolding.

410
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,994
This is a fairly nice,
simple unfolding.

411
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:16,160
It's mostly one dimensional.

412
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,770

413
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,340
All right.

414
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,000
You get the idea, right?

415
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,330
Pretty fun.

416
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,340
All right.

417
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,490
So, right.

418
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,610
Do I have anymore?

419
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,950
I think that was the
end of my slides.

420
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,010
I do have one more example in
the notes which is, if you just

421
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:42,700
want to make the flat
guys-- so just the two

422
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,530
dimensional
examples-- so we know

423
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:51,540
we could do that with five,
but you can also do with six.

424
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,940
We wrote another
program that looks

425
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,650
at a very special
kind of unfolding.

426
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:01,190
And in that special class,
it's possible to fold

427
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,560
all planar six
cubes-- hexacubes.

428
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:11,200
But that class does not work
for septacubes-- seven cubes.

429
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,230
Open question, is there
a common unfolding

430
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,530
of all planar seven cubes or
all non-planar seven cubes?

431
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,940
Or how many can you make?

432
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,975
There it was beyond exhaustion,
and we have to actually think.

433
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:24,850
Unless you come up with
a good class and then

434
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,370
you can exhaust
it in that class.

435
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:31,240
One nice open question here
is, if you go to large N,

436
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,100
are there some two polycubes
that have no common unfolding?

437
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,680
At the moment, it
could be every pair

438
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,670
of polycubes has a
common unfolding.

439
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,370
Certainly there
are-- for example,

440
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,520
in this class there
are four polycubes that

441
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,760
do not have a common unfolding.

442
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,870
I think we're not
sure about three.

443
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,975
For size five.

444
00:19:49,975 --> 00:19:51,850
Of course, we don't even
know whether there's

445
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,134
any polycube that
has no unfolding.

446
00:19:55,134 --> 00:19:56,300
I think there should be one.

447
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,370
But at the moment, it
could be every polycube

448
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,540
has an unfolding.

449
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,970
But to make it a little harder,
what about two polycubes

450
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,882
at once you want a
common unfolding?

451
00:20:03,882 --> 00:20:05,090
All these questions are open.

452
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,910

453
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,310
All right.

454
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,010
This is common unfolding.

455
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,340
We're going to stick
with unfolding stuff

456
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,050
but change around the
problem a little bit.

457
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,290
So let me ask you a question.

458
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:25,040
Can have a vote for those who
haven't read the notes already

459
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,200
and know the answer.

460
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,010
So let's say,
orthogonal polyhedron.

461
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,770
We talk a lot about
orthogonal polyhedra.

462
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:41,290
See all this polycube
stuff is in that genre.

463
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,980
And so way back when we
talked about grid unfolding

464
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,320
of orthogonal polyhedra.

465
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,002
It's not known whether
that's possible,

466
00:20:48,002 --> 00:20:49,460
but we have epsilon
unfolding where

467
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,080
you cut exponentially
many times and so on.

468
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,600
But how do you define
orthogonal polyhedra?

469
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,020
There are two
natural definitions.

470
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,320
One is that the
angles are right.

471
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,910

472
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,115
Right angles, let's
say, in the faces.

473
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:11,050

474
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:15,060
The other natural definition
is that you look at two faces

475
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,820
and the angles between
those should be right.

476
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:23,345

477
00:21:23,345 --> 00:21:24,720
So I guess right
dihedral angles.

478
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,580

479
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,485
Right face angles or
right dihedral angles.

480
00:21:31,485 --> 00:21:36,330
The question is, are
these the same thing?

481
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,330
Who thinks yes?

482
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,931
Who thinks no?

483
00:21:40,931 --> 00:21:41,430
Yeah.

484
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,450
I kind of set it up.

485
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:45,435
Everyone thinks no.

486
00:21:45,435 --> 00:21:46,310
They're not the same.

487
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,980

488
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,220
But for genus zero
polyhedra, they are the same.

489
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,490
That's maybe the
surprising thing.

490
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:00,680
This is a genus
eight polyhedron.

491
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,950
No, seven.

492
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:05,450
It's always a little
tricky to measure genus.

493
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,450
If it just had one triangular
face that would be-- well,

494
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,910
anyway, that's genus seven.

495
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,204
I'm not going to
try to convince you.

496
00:22:14,204 --> 00:22:15,620
This is an unfolding
of the thing.

497
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,147
So you can see,
in the unfolding,

498
00:22:17,147 --> 00:22:18,980
it looks like it's an
orthogonal polyhedron.

499
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,080
All the angles are right.

500
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,050
It looks perfect.

501
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,500
And yet, it folds into
this non-orthogonal thing.

502
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,240
Kind of a thickened octahedron.

503
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,460
It's kind of critical that it
has a genus more than zero.

504
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,440
In this paper-- this
is the original paper

505
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:41,710
that considered this problem--
there's a lower bound of one.

506
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,610
The genus 0 is not enough.

507
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:50,230
Then we came along-- I don't
have the author list here.

508
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:55,870
It's with the Waterloo gang, it
was Therese Biedl and others.

509
00:22:55,870 --> 00:23:02,550
And this is a smaller genus,
a genus six polyhedron.

510
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,260
This guy.

511
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,040
So it's almost the same
example turned inside out.

512
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,710
So this like to half
octahedra and then joined

513
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,730
in this cubicle frame
and then you put caps

514
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:14,490
on the cubicle frame to make
there not be holes out there.

515
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,620
And then you have
slightly smaller genus

516
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,110
because you can go
around the backside.

517
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,330
So that's the best known,
is a genus six example.

518
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,270
We proved that you need
genus at least three

519
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,531
in order for such
an example to exist.

520
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,530
I have a little sketch
of the proof in the notes

521
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,150
if you want to read it.

522
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,110
It's a fun little boot
strapping argument but I would--

523
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,240
I'm going to go on
to other fun topics

524
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,310
here rather than prove this.

525
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,089
Is that a good plan?

526
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:42,130
I think that's good plan.

527
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,330

528
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:45,830
OK.

529
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,560
So this is a fun
kind of-- unfoldings

530
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,930
can be orthogonal while the
three dimensional versions are

531
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,555
not orthogonal.

532
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,800

533
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,050
All right.

534
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:56,635
Next topic.

535
00:23:56,635 --> 00:24:01,370

536
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,760
I'm going to go back to
Alexandrov's theorem.

537
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,120
Turns out there is a
smooth version of that.

538
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,810
So now we're going
to segue a little bit

539
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:13,715
into smooth foldings
and smooth unfoldings.

540
00:24:13,715 --> 00:24:16,230

541
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,640
So instead of thinking of
polyhedron objects-- polygons

542
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,680
and convex polyhedra-- I want
to think about smooth bodies.

543
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:33,260
So, for example, suppose
I take a smooth convex

544
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,320
shape like an
ellipse or something

545
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,450
and I picked two
perimeter antipodes

546
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:48,691
and I do perimeter having
gluing where this is defines--

547
00:24:48,691 --> 00:24:50,690
as I walk along the
perimeter in both directions

548
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,960
it-- I obviously
didn't do it perfectly,

549
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,974
they should meet at
exactly the same time.

550
00:24:55,974 --> 00:24:56,890
This defines a gluing.

551
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,600
For every point there
is a corresponding point

552
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,400
it gets glued to.

553
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,280
This is a way to make what is
locally like a convex surface

554
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,700
because at any point, at
most 360 degrees of material

555
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,760
is glued there because
this thing was convex.

556
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,520
And the same way as
for convex polygons,

557
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,974
does this make a convex
something in three dimensions?

558
00:25:14,974 --> 00:25:16,890
It's not going to make
a polyhedron because it

559
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,680
has this curve,
but indeed it does

560
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,200
make a convex smooth surface.

561
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:40,160
So every convex metric
that's topologically a sphere

562
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,725
is realized by a
unique convex surface.

563
00:25:45,725 --> 00:25:53,710

564
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,360
So Alexandrov's theorem was
identical to this statement

565
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,930
except it also had
polyhedral up here,

566
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:02,240
that there were finite number
of points of nonzero curvature.

567
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,390
Now we have
infinitely many points

568
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,050
of slightly positive
curvature because, again, this

569
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,450
is supposed to sum to 4 pi.

570
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,730
That's still true.

571
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,567
But it's now an integral
instead of a sum.

572
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:15,150
So each of these things sort of
has an infinitesimal curvature

573
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:18,750
and if you integrate
them it adds up to 4 pi.

574
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,690
You can check that.

575
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,170
So this will make something.

576
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,254
I encourage you to try
this out, again, with tape.

577
00:26:26,254 --> 00:26:28,045
You're going to
approximate it because tape

578
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,330
is going to be polygonal.

579
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,020
But it works.

580
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,640
It will make something.

581
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,120
I particularly-- I should
mention the idea of this proof

582
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,610
is just to take limits
of regular Alexandrov.

583
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:41,099
Take closer and closer
polyhedral approximations.

584
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,140
In the polyhedral world
we can use that induction

585
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,670
that we talked about.

586
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,220
In the smooth case, you
can't, but the smooth case

587
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,680
is the limit of the polyhedral
case so it works out.

588
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,080
This is proved by a student
of Alexandrov Pogorelov

589
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,360
in the '70s, whereas he
proved his theorem in the '40s

590
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,058
or '50s.

591
00:27:01,058 --> 00:27:03,230
One really fun thing you
could do with this theorem

592
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:07,050
is, instead of using
just one convex shape,

593
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:11,889
you could use two convex shapes
and zip them to each other.

594
00:27:11,889 --> 00:27:13,055
And this is called a D-form.

595
00:27:13,055 --> 00:27:16,320
It was invented by an
artist, Tony Wills.

596
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,072
So here I've taken
two-- in this case,

597
00:27:18,072 --> 00:27:19,530
two identical
convect shapes-- they

598
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,740
don't have to be identical--
picked two points to glue them

599
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,126
to each other and then you
just zip around the perimeter.

600
00:27:26,126 --> 00:27:28,750
And again, because you're always
gluing convex angles to convex

601
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,560
angles-- the smooth
convex angles--

602
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,340
but they're still less than
180, so you glue them together,

603
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,260
it's less than 360.

604
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,860
And in this case, it's-- we
could actually figure out

605
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,730
and think about what 3D shape
you get so we could build that

606
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,120
in Mathematica.

607
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,560
But in general, you get
some weird convex shape.

608
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,894
For a while there were
some examples of this

609
00:27:48,894 --> 00:27:50,810
but no one knew exactly
what they looked like.

610
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:54,300
Then, I think it was a
project in this class

611
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,680
or it came out of the problem
session in this class three

612
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,400
years ago, Greg
Price and I proved

613
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,430
that these things
are nice in the sense

614
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,770
that the only place
you get creases

615
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:08,320
is along the seam,
the pink stuff.

616
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,810
Both for-- these
are called D-forms,

617
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:13,460
these have another-- I
think these are pita-forms,

618
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,890
if I recall, where you take one
convex shape instead of two.

619
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,560
Here you only get--
you can get the creases

620
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,410
along the seam and
one extra crease,

621
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,252
if I recall correctly here.

622
00:28:23,252 --> 00:28:24,960
And here you don't
get any extra creases.

623
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,310
It's always smooth
except at the seam.

624
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:30,520
And also, if you just take
the seam-- the pink part--

625
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,530
and take the convex hull of that
thing, you get the same thing.

626
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,550
So it doesn't go outside.

627
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,740
It's really tightly
wrapped around wherever

628
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,310
the seam happens to go.

629
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:44,430
Remember, this thing is
unique by Pogorelov's theorem.

630
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,560
So it's kind of nice to
know that structurally these

631
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,030
are pretty nice and smooth.

632
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:52,380
If your original shapes
are smooth convex bodies,

633
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,840
you will get a
nice, smooth shape

634
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,180
at the end that only has
creases at the seams.

635
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,660
Cool.

636
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,505
Again, please try to it at home.

637
00:29:02,505 --> 00:29:04,009
It's lots of fun.

638
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:04,925
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

639
00:29:04,925 --> 00:29:16,855

640
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:17,730
PROFESSOR: Let's see.

641
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:21,260
This point should glue to here.

642
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,670
I mean, it's
perfectly symmetric.

643
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:27,070
AUDIENCE: I'm looking
at the 3D form.

644
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,190
PROFESSOR: The 3D form.

645
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:32,700
So one of the two shapes
is here and the other one

646
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,670
is here and goes around
the back to there.

647
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,840
And it's, again, symmetric.

648
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,130
This is a nice example because
we have those parallel lines.

649
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,830
Usually you wouldn't have that.

650
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:48,626
And they're harder to
draw, is the challenge.

651
00:29:48,626 --> 00:29:50,000
Here, obviously,
we're doing sort

652
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,210
of a polygonal approximation.

653
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:53,830
You see all the lines.

654
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,480
All right.

655
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,730
This is a smooth version of
folding-- a smooth version

656
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,130
of Alexandrov's theorem.

657
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:05,000
We can also think about
smooth versions of unfolding.

658
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,020
So here there is
exactly one paper

659
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:16,650
by Nadia Benbernou whose in
the front row and Heather--

660
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,482
AUDIENCE: Patricia.

661
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:21,380
PROFESSOR: Patricia
Khan and Joe O'Rourke.

662
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:25,220
So this is a prismatoid.

663
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,940
It's a little hard to
see the bottom face

664
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,220
but there's a convex polygon on
the bottom, a parallel convex

665
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,390
polygon on the top.

666
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:35,320
You take the convex hull--
sorry, they're not polygons.

667
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,560
They're smooth convex bodies.

668
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,140
So you've got one in the floor
plane, one in a parallel plane

669
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,940
up top.

670
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,800
You take the convex hull, you
get this nice smooth thing

671
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,160
around the outside.

672
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,070
Now, we have to generalize
our notion of unfolding

673
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,190
because normally with
unfolding this would take

674
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,910
an infinite number of cuts
to-- we have to cut everywhere

675
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:53,660
there's curvature.

676
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,493
Which means we're going
to have to cut along

677
00:30:55,493 --> 00:30:56,750
all those black lines.

678
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:01,990
Which means we slice the thing
into very infinitesimal pieces.

679
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:06,030
But if you think
of it as a limit

680
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:11,130
of regular polyhedral things--
here I have a little example.

681
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:15,870
Let's think about the limit in
a simpler example to start with.

682
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,500
So imagine you want
to take a pyramid--

683
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:23,386
so the top poly-- the top
convex shape is just a point.

684
00:31:23,386 --> 00:31:25,145
I guess it looks like
a cone but down here

685
00:31:25,145 --> 00:31:31,680
it could be anything, could be
an ellipse or any convex shape.

686
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,980
Well, we can think of this as
a polyhedral approximation.

687
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,920
So, for example, we take
a hexagon on the bottom,

688
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,090
we want to unfold that.

689
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,660
And in particular, we
thought about these--

690
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:49,020
these are the
pyramids-- and we--

691
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:53,330
one of the unfoldings of
them is the volcano unfolding

692
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:56,394
if you remember back to
the unfolding lecture.

693
00:31:56,394 --> 00:31:57,060
Looks like that.

694
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:00,710
All these triangles just fold
out, get all those parts.

695
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,160
That never overlaps,
it's sort of trivial.

696
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,930
You take the limit of that.

697
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:09,010
In the limit, the floor becomes
whatever the convex shape.

698
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:13,740
Maybe-- let's think about the
simple case where it's a disk.

699
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:18,709
And in the limit you're getting
lots of really tiny triangles.

700
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:21,000
You take that all the way to
limit, what you're getting

701
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,450
is actually a concentric
circle around there.

702
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:29,600
So really, these
become segments.

703
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,470
Now, what's funny about
this limit is, normally--

704
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:37,960
before you get to the end, you
see there's these big gaps.

705
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,674
A lot of the area's missing.

706
00:32:39,674 --> 00:32:41,590
These things are getting
infinitesimally small

707
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:44,070
and yet they have to
spread over this big range.

708
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,150
So most of this area
is actually absent.

709
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:48,566
When you take the limit you
can't really see that anymore.

710
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:49,750
It just becomes filled in.

711
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:55,360
And so in this unfolding,
the area of the green stuff,

712
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,620
if you just took that area
measured on the floor,

713
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:02,100
it's going to be larger
than the area in the pink.

714
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,220
So this is not an area
preserving unfolding

715
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,920
which makes it a little weird.

716
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,420
But it's still well defined.

717
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,811
I mean, you wouldn't
actually-- well,

718
00:33:09,811 --> 00:33:12,060
for example-- we're going
to get to this in a moment--

719
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:15,350
if you actually took material
like this out of, say,

720
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:18,070
tin foil, something
that can crinkle,

721
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:21,790
then you should be able to
crinkle it into this shape.

722
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,520
I'll talk about
how to prove that.

723
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,520
That's actually most of
the rest of the lecture,

724
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,590
is about that kind
of notion of folding.

725
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,020
It's more like origami,
though, than unfolding

726
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,520
because you're sort of
over covering stuff.

727
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,530
And here-- actually,
here the hard part

728
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:39,610
is not so much to show
these ribs don't intersect,

729
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,610
although they don't and
it's not totally obvious

730
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:44,450
because here they're kind
of going towards each other.

731
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:48,349
But they won't actually
intersect in the unfolding.

732
00:33:48,349 --> 00:33:50,890
One of the tricky parts is to
show that the top face actually

733
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,650
can fit somewhere,
so you actually

734
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:55,900
get an unfolding of this thing.

735
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,720
And I forget, this is choosing
some kind of extreme rib

736
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,165
and putting it out there.

737
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,740
It's a nice line of
separation if I recall.

738
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,730

739
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:13,500
This is funny because here we
have a limit of some process.

740
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:20,340
Now, for pyramids we know
the volcano unfolding works.

741
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,350
For prismatoids,
regular prismatoids

742
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,929
are when you take
some convex polygon

743
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:29,750
and some other parallel convex
polygon, take the convex hull.

744
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:35,260

745
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:38,120
We don't know whether
these have edge unfoldings.

746
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,469
Still an open problem.

747
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:43,940
And yet, for the
smooth case, we do.

748
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,449
Kind of magical.

749
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:46,719
I know why that's true.

750
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,448
It's somehow the edge
constraint is harder.

751
00:34:50,448 --> 00:34:52,489
If you're not just worried
about edge unfoldings,

752
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:54,760
we do know how to
unfold those obviously.

753
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,810
You can do star unfolding,
source unfolding.

754
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:00,446
Here, edge unfolding--
well, we have

755
00:35:00,446 --> 00:35:02,320
to cut along all those
infinitely many edges.

756
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,110
That makes it easier,
much smoother.

757
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:07,632

758
00:35:07,632 --> 00:35:09,590
But it's funny when the
smooth case is actually

759
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,660
easier than the discrete case.

760
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,160
All right.

761
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,750

762
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:18,372
The next problem I want to
talk about is chocolate.

763
00:35:18,372 --> 00:35:22,180

764
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,600
I have here a bunch of
spherical chocolates.

765
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,150
The most-- apparently the only
perfectly spherical chocolate,

766
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,810
at least according
to the advertisement,

767
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:34,140
is this thing called
the Mozart Kugel.

768
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,730
Now, Mozart Kugel-- how many
people have eaten them before.

769
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,171
Just a couple.

770
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:39,670
Good stuff.

771
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,030
It's, I guess, more
a European thing.

772
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,290
It's from Austria.

773
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:48,650
It's invented in early
1900s, I forget exactly when.

774
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:51,177
It was a big thing at the
time because making chocolate

775
00:35:51,177 --> 00:35:52,510
perfectly spherical is not easy.

776
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,730
It's like, how do
you hold it and not

777
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:55,960
get little indentations?

778
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,120
This thing is
perfectly spherical.

779
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,911
Here I'll show you.

780
00:35:57,911 --> 00:36:00,370

781
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:05,540
But, really, the question I
wonder, because as an origamist

782
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,770
you wonder, how do
you wrap this thing?

783
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,565
Oh, I ripped it.

784
00:36:09,565 --> 00:36:11,095
I'll try to do this
more carefully.

785
00:36:11,095 --> 00:36:15,320

786
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,286
It's not how you usually
eat chocolate, is it?

787
00:36:18,286 --> 00:36:21,020
Open very carefully.

788
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,520
It's OK.

789
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,340
I have more in case I fail.

790
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:24,975
More chocolate.

791
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:28,500

792
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,301
Not enough for you, I'm afraid.

793
00:36:31,301 --> 00:36:32,300
So ignore the chocolate.

794
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,910

795
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,860
It's not the Droid
you're looking for.

796
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,830
It's not the chocolate.

797
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,330
So it's a rectangle.

798
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,955
I didn't do a perfect job.

799
00:36:43,955 --> 00:36:45,570
There's a few
little tears there.

800
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,820
But they fold-- Mirabell.

801
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:52,237
Mirabell makes the most
Mozart Kugel in the world.

802
00:36:52,237 --> 00:36:53,820
Mozart Kugel is very
cool because it's

803
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,400
built in-- built up
in concentric spheres.

804
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,900
You have the marzipan layer,
then the milk chocolate layer,

805
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,380
then the nougat layer, then
the dark chocolate layer,

806
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,710
if I recall.

807
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:08,030
Each brand has a
different recipe,

808
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,824
but they're always
spherical on the outside.

809
00:37:10,824 --> 00:37:12,490
It's kind of like
glassblowing actually.

810
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,930
It's kind of fun.

811
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:18,840
And each company has a
slightly different way-- well,

812
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,690
I've studied only
two main companies.

813
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:24,820
Mirabell makes the most of them
but they are not the original.

814
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:29,194
They are called the
echta which is--

815
00:37:29,194 --> 00:37:29,990
AUDIENCE: The real.

816
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,860
PROFESSOR: The real.

817
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,660
The authentic.

818
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,380
But-- now, these
are hard to come by.

819
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,970
These are brought to me by
my student, [INAUDIBLE],

820
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,040
some of you know.

821
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,019
Architecture.

822
00:37:44,019 --> 00:37:45,560
This is the-- oh,
it says in English.

823
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,430
It's kind of easy.

824
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,500
The original Salzburger
Mozart Kugel.

825
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,290
Mozart was-- lived
in Salzburg, I guess.

826
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:55,010
And so this is named after him.

827
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:55,960
Oh, 1884.

828
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,080
Wow.

829
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,810
So that's when they started.

830
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:04,526
Now, these guys--
I think I've only

831
00:38:04,526 --> 00:38:05,900
had like one of
these in my life.

832
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,920
I'm really excited.

833
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,462
The Mirabell's are
OK, but this stuff?

834
00:38:09,462 --> 00:38:09,962
Wow.

835
00:38:09,962 --> 00:38:14,384

836
00:38:14,384 --> 00:38:15,800
Oh, it's so much
easier to unfold.

837
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,310
I like-- this is, I
think, probably handmade.

838
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:19,950
Much more handmade.

839
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:23,480
In fact, you can kind of tell
it's not perfectly spherical.

840
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,230
It has a little nub at the top.

841
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:28,126
So this is probably more how
they were originally made.

842
00:38:28,126 --> 00:38:30,094
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

843
00:38:30,094 --> 00:38:31,760
PROFESSOR: What, are
you getting hungry?

844
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,410

845
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:36,380
Now, Furst-- Furst
is the company

846
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:41,411
who made the first Mozart
Kugel-- they use squares.

847
00:38:41,411 --> 00:38:42,910
I claim they're a
little bit better.

848
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:48,340
But interesting question is,
which uses more material?

849
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,660
Something to think about.

850
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:55,930
Meanwhile-- I won't
torture you more by eating.

851
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:58,900

852
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,500
All right.

853
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,970
So this is a Mozart
Kugel problem.

854
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,750

855
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:12,160
This paper started when-- I
think we are in New Orleans.

856
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,700
Some part of the gang
was in New Orleans

857
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,120
and there was this
deadline the next day

858
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,036
and it was for this workshop
on computational geometry--

859
00:39:20,036 --> 00:39:21,660
the European workshop--
and it happened

860
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,000
to be in Austria that
year-- that coming year.

861
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,830
We're like, what
paper could we write?

862
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,270
And we're sitting there
in the little cafe eating

863
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,540
these beignets of
doughnuts and thinking,

864
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,165
what could we write
a paper about?

865
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:36,120
It's like, how about food?

866
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,850
And what does Austria have?

867
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:42,450
Well, [SPEAKING GERMAN]
Well, how about Mozart Kugel?

868
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,940
So-- this is how
research happens.

869
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,190
But it's really cool.

870
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,910
It's really cool because
this is not your--

871
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:54,900
this is not the origami you
grew up with in this class.

872
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,930
Because you can't fold a
sphere out of a square paper.

873
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:01,470
And yet, this was a square
folded into a sphere.

874
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:06,150
Somehow that was done using
a finite amount of effort.

875
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:09,010
Whereas if you use regular
paper to fold something

876
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,150
that has positive
curvature everywhere,

877
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,260
you need infinitely
many creases.

878
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,000
And yet this is fairly
practical to do.

879
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,480
This is hand wrapped.

880
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,410
In theory, I could re-wrap this.

881
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,070
I've never actually tried.

882
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,260
But something like this.

883
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,715
It works pretty well.

884
00:40:22,715 --> 00:40:26,360
I even covered the tip.

885
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,820
How did I do that
in finite effort?

886
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,340
Well, of course it's
not a perfect sphere.

887
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,990
But we need to model
this mathematically.

888
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:35,125
It's annoying to
take approximations.

889
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:37,000
I would like a model of
folding that actually

890
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,970
does make it possible
to fold a sphere.

891
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,990
So this is the idea of
contractive folding.

892
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:50,490

893
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,710
We haven't been super rigorous
about defining origami,

894
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:57,470
but I always say you
take a piece of paper,

895
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:00,390
you can't stretch the paper,
you can't tear the paper,

896
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,900
and you can't self-intersect.

897
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,480
We're going to relax the
you can't stretch the paper.

898
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,270
You still can't
stretch the paper,

899
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:10,560
but now the paper can contract.

900
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,610
So it can't get longer
but it can get shorter.

901
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:15,140
It's like cables from
tensegrity theory.

902
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,970
So you take any pair of points.

903
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:19,800
There's some distance as
measured on the piece of paper.

904
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,040
When you fold this thing
into your awesome sphere,

905
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,250
you take the two points,
you measure the distance

906
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,390
along the surface of
the piece of paper.

907
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:31,410
Now, I'll-- normally
with origami,

908
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:34,350
these two distances
should be equal.

909
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,940
That's isometry.

910
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,940
That's regular origami.

911
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:44,690
But if I say that this one--
so write equal that way.

912
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:50,990
If this one can be smaller,
then this is contractive.

913
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:55,420
And that is paper that can
shrink but not stretch.

914
00:41:55,420 --> 00:42:05,864
So pairwise distances
don't increase.

915
00:42:05,864 --> 00:42:07,030
So they could stay the same.

916
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,210
We could still do
regular origami.

917
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:11,570
But we can also contract.

918
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,640
And then it is possible
to fold a sphere.

919
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,190
Now, intuitively,
what's going on

920
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:20,880
is, when you fold out of
tinfoil, you can crinkle.

921
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,340
And that lets you not have
to worry about-- I mean,

922
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,290
this is pretty good
approximation to a sphere

923
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:30,540
especially when I have
a good base underneath

924
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:34,590
to approximate against.

925
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:37,750
I'm doing lots of little
tiny creases in order

926
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:42,580
to approximate that contractive
mapping, contractive folding.

927
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:46,850
So, conveniently,
there's a theorem

928
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,090
that tells us this
is always possible.

929
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:50,840
I'll tell you the theorem.

930
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,850
This is another theorem
by Burago and Zalgallar

931
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:59,060
who proved the other
theorem that if you

932
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:03,880
have any polyhedral
metric you can turn it

933
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,730
into some polyhedron,
not necessarily convex.

934
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:11,110
So they solved that problem
plus they solved this problem.

935
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:16,080
If you take a contractive-- they
only solved the smooth case.

936
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,150
I imagine this works
for piecewise smooth.

937
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:22,570
You take a contractive
C2 immersion--

938
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:25,200
it's just some fancy
word for folding,

939
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,560
it has some extra constraints
but let's not worry about it.

940
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,990
So C2 means continuous up
to the second derivative.

941
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:31,940
So nice and smooth.

942
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,950
Spheres are valid, for example.

943
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:42,214
Then any one of those
things has a C0--

944
00:43:42,214 --> 00:43:44,005
I'll just call it
polyhedral approximation.

945
00:43:44,005 --> 00:43:48,070

946
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:50,590
And this is approximation
in the Hausdorff sense

947
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:53,800
meaning you want
to fold the sphere.

948
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,700
If you just thicken that
sphere by some epsilon,

949
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,070
then you can sort of stay within
that epsilon thickened sphere

950
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,790
and do some kind of wiggling.

951
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:03,620
You'll be polyhedral
and you'll only

952
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,890
have finitely many creases.

953
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:09,680
So there-- if you have a nice,
smooth contracted folded state,

954
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,750
you could turn it into a regular
origami isometry folded state

955
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:16,110
that's arbitrarily
close to the sphere.

956
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:16,960
So for any epsilon.

957
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,590

958
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:25,060
So that's a convenient
theorem from 1996.

959
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,230
So that's the model.

960
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:30,370
Now we can think about, how
do I optimally wrap a sphere?

961
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:34,510
Now, there are
many possible goals

962
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:37,950
you might want to optimize
in wrapping a sphere.

963
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:40,130
Presumably, you want your
shape to tile the plane.

964
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:42,005
So you can cut out a
whole bunch of these out

965
00:44:42,005 --> 00:44:44,280
of one sheet of tinfoil.

966
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,500
Obviously Mirabell
likes rectangles,

967
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,090
Furst likes squares.

968
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:50,930
Are those the
right things to do?

969
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:52,730
What about triangles?

970
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:53,730
What about other shapes?

971
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,604
These are the sorts of
questions we consider.

972
00:44:55,604 --> 00:44:57,720
We don't have a complete
answer to this question.

973
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,142
But we have a lot of
fun-- fun things to do.

974
00:45:01,142 --> 00:45:02,600
What should I tell
you about first?

975
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:07,949

976
00:45:07,949 --> 00:45:08,740
I'm getting hungry.

977
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,570

978
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,320
Maybe I'll have the
rest of that Mirabell.

979
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,710
It's just sitting there.

980
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,910
Half a Mozart Kugel,
can't have that.

981
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:17,410
All right.

982
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:18,665
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

983
00:45:18,665 --> 00:45:19,290
PROFESSOR: Yes.

984
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:20,605
Question?

985
00:45:20,605 --> 00:45:21,730
AUDIENCE: I was wondering--

986
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:24,290
PROFESSOR: You can have any.

987
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:26,122
AUDIENCE: Because of
the fact that you've

988
00:45:26,122 --> 00:45:28,830
got this contracting
that occurs,

989
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:32,145
I was wondering-- it's obvious
that because of contracting

990
00:45:32,145 --> 00:45:39,420
you need more than 4 pi
r surface area of paper

991
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:44,090
to wrap a sphere--
a one unit sphere.

992
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:47,290
I'm wondering, do you
know exactly how much

993
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:49,541
paper do you require due to
the fact that [INAUDIBLE]?

994
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:50,581
PROFESSOR: Good question.

995
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,860
How much paper do you require?

996
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,450
Area is not being
preserved here.

997
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,670
Just like the continuous
unfolding stuff,

998
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,290
you don't preserve area.

999
00:45:58,290 --> 00:45:59,540
This is really the same thing.

1000
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,575
I think you can prove
this is a contractive map.

1001
00:46:01,575 --> 00:46:03,200
So if you had this
as a piece of paper,

1002
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,010
you really could fold
that smooth pyramid.

1003
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:11,070

1004
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:14,290
But you lose material when
you do a contractive mapping.

1005
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:17,380
And in the inverse, when you're
unfolding, you gain material.

1006
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:20,895
How much material
do I have to gain?

1007
00:46:20,895 --> 00:46:21,520
Think about it.

1008
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,330
You should be able to
answer that question.

1009
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:27,690
I'm going to tell you about some
stuff while you think about it.

1010
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,640
That was the original
question we started with.

1011
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,830
What's the minimum area
wrapping of a unit sphere?

1012
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:38,347
The surface area of a
sphere is 4 pi, FYI.

1013
00:46:38,347 --> 00:46:39,430
How much more do you need?

1014
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:42,070

1015
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:42,730
All right.

1016
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:46,460
To describe these unfoldings,
I guess they are, or wrappings,

1017
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,934
whichever way you're
thinking about going,

1018
00:46:48,934 --> 00:46:50,600
it's useful to have
some structure, kind

1019
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,090
of a backbone to the unfolding.

1020
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:54,900
So we came up with this
idea of stretched path.

1021
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,270
And you can show that any
kind of optimal wrapping

1022
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:59,760
will have at least
one stretch path.

1023
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,320
And our idea is
actually-- let me tell you

1024
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,170
what a stretch path is.

1025
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:10,330
This is a, let's say, a
path between two vertices

1026
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,490
whose length does not decrease.

1027
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:19,350
So it actually is
preserved in the folding.

1028
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:28,690

1029
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:31,650
So I have my sphere,
I have two points,

1030
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:33,460
take the shortest
path between them.

1031
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,160
That shortest path
is exactly what

1032
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,827
it is in the unfolding,
exactly the same length.

1033
00:47:37,827 --> 00:47:39,410
So that's what we
call a stretch path.

1034
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:41,110
There's no crinkling
along that path.

1035
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:43,650
There maybe crinkling on
either side of the path,

1036
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:46,050
but not on it.

1037
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:50,000
Our idea is-- OK, that gives
you some kind of structure.

1038
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,240
Our idea is to completely
cover the surface

1039
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,277
of the sphere with
stretched paths.

1040
00:47:55,277 --> 00:47:56,860
There's a lot of
ways you can do that.

1041
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:59,770
Some of them will be valid,
some of them won't be.

1042
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:02,969
The simplest one is
the source unfolding.

1043
00:48:02,969 --> 00:48:05,010
Or I guess you could call
it the source wrapping.

1044
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:08,220

1045
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:11,590
Wrapping somehow means
contractive I guess.

1046
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:15,050
Which is, you take your
sphere, take some point x,

1047
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:17,492
you take all the
shortest paths around x--

1048
00:48:17,492 --> 00:48:18,700
it's a little tricky to draw.

1049
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,197

1050
00:48:22,197 --> 00:48:24,280
In other words, the Voronoi
diagram at that point.

1051
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,700
Just like we did with
source unfolding.

1052
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:30,680
And you call all of these edges,
all those straight lines--

1053
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:35,520
geodesics, whatever-- they go to
this opposite south pole here.

1054
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,630
All of those lines you
call stretch paths.

1055
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:41,710
That determines an unfolding.

1056
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,220
And it happens to
be contractive.

1057
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:47,570
The unfolding will be a
big disk because you'll

1058
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:51,250
have the center-- call this x.

1059
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:54,000
This is 3D, this is 2D,
in case it wasn't clear.

1060
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,750
They both look the same.

1061
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:57,350
But now all those
paths are straight.

1062
00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:00,460

1063
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,760
And it's clear what the
lengths of these paths are.

1064
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:08,427
Each one of them is
half the circumference.

1065
00:49:08,427 --> 00:49:09,010
Circumference?

1066
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:10,051
Is that what you call it?

1067
00:49:10,051 --> 00:49:12,550
Half of an equator
of the sphere.

1068
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,850
Which for a unit sphere is pi.

1069
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:23,520
So this is radius pi, which
means the area of this thing

1070
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,250
is pi r squared.

1071
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:27,880
Sorry, the area is pi cubed.

1072
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,610

1073
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,110
Interesting.

1074
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:38,410
But pi cubed, you can
compute, is more than 4pi.

1075
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:43,080
Pi squared is
almost-- is over nine.

1076
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,980
It's over nine times pi.

1077
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,630
We want four times pi.

1078
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:48,840
This is an example of
not preserving area.

1079
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,180
What's happening is
there's lots of crinkling

1080
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,104
between these lines.

1081
00:49:52,104 --> 00:49:54,020
Now, there are infinitely
many of these lines.

1082
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:57,840
Every point is covered by
one of these stretched paths.

1083
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,960
But again, when I
unfold them, if I

1084
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:03,260
did a limiting approximation,
there'd be lots of holes here.

1085
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:04,826
But in the limit
there are no holes

1086
00:50:04,826 --> 00:50:06,200
and that's where
I waste material

1087
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,010
and that's where
I get contraction.

1088
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:08,995
Make sense?

1089
00:50:08,995 --> 00:50:12,522
I actually brought a
sphere, a couple spheres.

1090
00:50:12,522 --> 00:50:14,730
I brought some chocolate
spheres, but slightly bigger

1091
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:17,620
sphere so we can
think about this.

1092
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:22,340
In this case, we're making
stretch paths all around

1093
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:24,645
from the north pole
down to the south pole

1094
00:50:24,645 --> 00:50:26,820
and kind of cutting
at the south pole.

1095
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:29,312
And that's it.

1096
00:50:29,312 --> 00:50:30,288
All right.

1097
00:50:30,288 --> 00:50:34,200

1098
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:39,180
Has anyone solved the problem
of what the minimum area

1099
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,980
wrapping of the sphere is?

1100
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:42,480
Yeah?

1101
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,220
You solved it?

1102
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:44,070
Janine.

1103
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:44,860
Or an idea.

1104
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,820
AUDIENCE: I think
it's 4pi plus epsilon.

1105
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,719
PROFESSOR: 4pi plus
epsilon is correct.

1106
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:49,760
How do you want to do it?

1107
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,180

1108
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:53,880
Exactly.

1109
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,310
AUDIENCE: An apple
core-- or peeling.

1110
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:58,980
PROFESSOR: Apple peeling, yes.

1111
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,360
Or I prefer to think
of it as lecturer--

1112
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,170
I don't know which one--
the one about strip folding.

1113
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:06,130
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

1114
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:06,970
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1115
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:08,760
Exactly.

1116
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,200
So we had this result
about strip folding

1117
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:16,864
if you remember way back in
the folding anything lecture.

1118
00:51:16,864 --> 00:51:18,530
We talked about this
and then orgamizer.

1119
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:19,950
This was the inefficient method.

1120
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:24,080
But if you started with a
very long rectangle of paper,

1121
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,990
we could show that the
area of that piece of paper

1122
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:30,040
is arbitrary-- could
be made arbitrarily

1123
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,305
close to the area
of your polyhedron.

1124
00:51:32,305 --> 00:51:35,880

1125
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,536
So that area plus some epsilon.

1126
00:51:37,536 --> 00:51:38,910
And you can make
epsilon as small

1127
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:43,150
as you wanted just by
making this polygon longer.

1128
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:46,280
If you take a polyhedral
approximation of a sphere

1129
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,680
and apply this theorem, you'll
get very close to the surface

1130
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,270
area of that approximation which
is very close to the surface

1131
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:54,460
area of the sphere,
which is 4pi.

1132
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:58,220

1133
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:00,670
And then, if you take
an outer approximation,

1134
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:03,930
then you can just sort of
crinkle all those vertices down

1135
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:05,420
against the sphere.

1136
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,960
And you'll do-- it's
maybe not totally obvious,

1137
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,387
but it's not that hard.

1138
00:52:09,387 --> 00:52:11,970
You get a contractive map that
actually wraps the sphere using

1139
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:15,965
not much more surface
area than what you had.

1140
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:17,590
The same as what you
had, which was not

1141
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:18,780
much more than the sphere.

1142
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,520
So you can get 4pi plus epsilon.

1143
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,360
So it turns out, minimizing
the area of your wrapping

1144
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,772
is not that interesting
a question by itself

1145
00:52:25,772 --> 00:52:27,730
because there's kind of
this cheating solution.

1146
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:29,646
Obviously, you don't
want to manufacture that.

1147
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:30,880
I don't think.

1148
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,160
Maybe she built a robot, did
the inverse orange peeling,

1149
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,729
it would be pretty cool.

1150
00:52:37,729 --> 00:52:40,020
But if you're trying to sell
this idea to confectioners

1151
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,999
around the world, I
wouldn't recommend

1152
00:52:42,999 --> 00:52:44,040
attempting strip folding.

1153
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,530
So we would like
something that's

1154
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:50,910
reasonably nice but-- yeah.

1155
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:51,750
OK.

1156
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:54,195
AUDIENCE: So if
you're trying sell

1157
00:52:54,195 --> 00:53:00,063
wrapper companies [INAUDIBLE]
square or rectangular amounts

1158
00:53:00,063 --> 00:53:02,508
would these be 4pi squared?

1159
00:53:02,508 --> 00:53:04,953
Because you're basically
producing something

1160
00:53:04,953 --> 00:53:08,820
that maybe would expand
the circumference and--

1161
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,820
PROFESSOR: Well, OK, an
interesting question is,

1162
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,024
what is the surface
area of these wrappings?

1163
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,940
These actually have
pretty special properties,

1164
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,470
the rectangle and
the-- I'm getting

1165
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:19,940
hungry-- and the square.

1166
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:23,440

1167
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,736
Have you thought about which
of these has more surface area?

1168
00:53:27,736 --> 00:53:29,530
The rectangle has more?

1169
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:31,610
Who thinks the
rectangle has more?

1170
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:33,974
Who thinks the square has more?

1171
00:53:33,974 --> 00:53:35,140
Who thinks they're the same?

1172
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:38,640

1173
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,140
Seed you with that idea.

1174
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,720
Well, they're actually the same.

1175
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,699
I'll explain why
in a little bit.

1176
00:53:45,699 --> 00:53:46,490
It's crazy, I know.

1177
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:51,080

1178
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:54,345
I prefer the square because
it has less perimeter.

1179
00:53:54,345 --> 00:53:59,510

1180
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:01,420
There are obviously many
things you might not

1181
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:03,250
like about this strip folding.

1182
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:06,240
It has high aspect
ratio, but in particular,

1183
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,120
one way to characterize
why this is nasty,

1184
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,130
it says high perimeter.

1185
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:14,415
Perimeter is annoying
because-- for a few reasons.

1186
00:54:14,415 --> 00:54:16,206
Intuitively, if you
started with the sphere

1187
00:54:16,206 --> 00:54:18,390
and you wanted to
cut it open, then you

1188
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:20,570
need a lot of cutting
because the perimeter is

1189
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:22,360
the amount that you cut.

1190
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,650
Or it's twice that.

1191
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:28,882
So conversely, when you're
trying to wrap a surface,

1192
00:54:28,882 --> 00:54:30,340
if you have high
perimeter, there's

1193
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,700
a lot to worry about, lots of
things that have to match up.

1194
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,240
So you've got to be very
careful in your crinkling.

1195
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,198
Whereas I really didn't
have to be very careful

1196
00:54:38,198 --> 00:54:41,640
wrapping with the square
because it has low perimeter.

1197
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,810
Another sense in which
perimeter is annoying

1198
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:46,370
is you're going to
have some error.

1199
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:50,900
So in fact, you can't just
perfectly wrap a sphere.

1200
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,240
Like, if I took a disk
of exactly this size,

1201
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,600
I probably couldn't
wrap a sphere with it

1202
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,262
because I'm going to
lose just some epsilon

1203
00:54:58,262 --> 00:54:59,720
and then there'll
be a little point

1204
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,220
around the south
pole that's missing.

1205
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:05,530
If you're really going to
build confectionery-- build

1206
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:08,390
confectionery-- if you're really
going to wrap confectionery,

1207
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:10,360
you probably make this
a little bit bigger.

1208
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:14,010
How much area do
you lose when you

1209
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,510
make your thing a
little bit bigger?

1210
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:18,137
Well, it's roughly the
perimeter times epsilon.

1211
00:55:18,137 --> 00:55:20,720
It's a little bit different from
that, but basically perimeter

1212
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,580
times epsilon.

1213
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:23,550
So if you minimize
perimeter, then

1214
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:27,444
your area wastage from
double coverage will go down.

1215
00:55:27,444 --> 00:55:28,860
So really what I
want is something

1216
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:32,640
that's low area
and low perimeter.

1217
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,590
That's our new goal.

1218
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:37,320
And that's why I like
Furst better than Mirabell,

1219
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,010
not just because
they taste better.

1220
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:41,722
I really should verify
that they taste better.

1221
00:55:41,722 --> 00:55:44,510
Oh, yeah.

1222
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:47,020
Now, they're very
different insides.

1223
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:50,080
Oh, but it's so good.

1224
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,730
Oh, much better chocolate.

1225
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:52,240
All right.

1226
00:55:52,240 --> 00:56:00,048

1227
00:56:00,048 --> 00:56:03,660
Maybe I should have a
lottery for eating the rest.

1228
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:07,390

1229
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:08,070
Petal wrapping.

1230
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:12,290

1231
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:15,510
This is going to be
another way to put stretch

1232
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:17,950
paths on the sphere and
get an unfolding-- get

1233
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:20,910
a contractive
wrapping from that.

1234
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:22,891
Which actually
corresponds to this toy.

1235
00:56:22,891 --> 00:56:24,640
I don't know if you
ever played with this.

1236
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,960
The Frisbee that's also a ball.

1237
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,620

1238
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,440
These-- you see those cuts?

1239
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,339

1240
00:56:33,339 --> 00:56:35,130
Those are the shortest
paths from the north

1241
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:37,700
pole to the south pole.

1242
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:40,530
But we're not--
before we were sort

1243
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:44,150
of using-- kind of slicing
along but also preserving--

1244
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:47,280
that's kind of confusing--
all of them, infinitely many.

1245
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,780
Now I want to do
with finitely many.

1246
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,740
Here I only have six.

1247
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,300
Six?

1248
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:52,950
Yes, six.

1249
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:56,272

1250
00:56:56,272 --> 00:56:57,230
Doesn't have to be six.

1251
00:56:57,230 --> 00:56:59,760
Could be any number k.

1252
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:06,570
So I'm going to look at k
stretch paths from north pole

1253
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:07,350
to south pole.

1254
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:10,690
So I have my sphere,
here is my north pole.

1255
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:14,700
I do some constant number.

1256
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,870
Here I've done five.

1257
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:20,647
This is equally spaced
angular around the north pole,

1258
00:57:20,647 --> 00:57:22,480
they all go to the south
pole on the bottom.

1259
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,770

1260
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:27,424
Something like that.

1261
00:57:27,424 --> 00:57:28,840
It's going to start
getting messy.

1262
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,660

1263
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,290
These are going to
be stretch paths.

1264
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:38,410
I have to fill these orange
slices in between them.

1265
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:41,130
How should I fill them?

1266
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:43,957
Here's an idea.

1267
00:57:43,957 --> 00:57:45,540
It's kind of like
the Voronoi diagram.

1268
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:50,985
Voronoi diagram is you grow from
many objects simultaneously.

1269
00:57:50,985 --> 00:57:54,050
With this sphere wrapping
we grew from a single point

1270
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:56,630
in all directions.

1271
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:57,300
That was it.

1272
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,880
Now, I've drawn these paths.

1273
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,620
What if I grew from all of these
finite stretch paths at once?

1274
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:06,799
What I would get, these
would at some point converge.

1275
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,840
They would converge at
the angular bisector here.

1276
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:13,260

1277
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,060
Along the way,
what's happening is

1278
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:19,830
each of these points is kind of
tracing along a straight line,

1279
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:22,410
so to speak, a
great circular arc

1280
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:25,140
until it reaches that point.

1281
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:28,170
I'm going to make
these stretched paths,

1282
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:31,294
and these are also stretched
pads, and basically cutting

1283
00:58:31,294 --> 00:58:32,210
along the dotted line.

1284
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:35,810

1285
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:36,310
OK.

1286
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:38,300
I won't draw all of them.

1287
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,360
But you get the idea.

1288
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:42,515
When you unfold this thing, you
have these kind of wish bones.

1289
00:58:42,515 --> 00:58:52,040

1290
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,930
These guys meet sort
of perpendicularly.

1291
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:57,202
So when you unfold you
preserve those angles.

1292
00:58:57,202 --> 00:58:58,660
Remember these are
stretched paths.

1293
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,930
These lengths are preserved.

1294
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:04,280
The stuff in between,
it's really a curved thing

1295
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,880
and it gets slightly
larger in this thing.

1296
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,900
We call this thing a petal.

1297
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:12,090
But this is an
unfolding of this sort

1298
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,080
of one fifth of the sphere.

1299
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:18,160
This is the center line and
these are the two sides.

1300
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:23,040
So that's the idea
of petal wrapping.

1301
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,450
Now, there's different ways
to join these petals together.

1302
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:30,520
One idea is join them
all at the north pole.

1303
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,890
So then what you get--
it's a little hard

1304
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:35,520
to imagine that these things
don't intersect each other,

1305
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,620
especially when I've
drawn them so fat.

1306
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:39,745
For five, it's going to
look something like this.

1307
00:59:39,745 --> 00:59:42,659

1308
00:59:42,659 --> 00:59:43,700
I'm drawing it perfectly.

1309
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,159

1310
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:47,950
They won't actually
intersect in the center

1311
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:50,033
because the total amount
of material at the center

1312
00:59:50,033 --> 00:59:52,160
is only 360 degrees.

1313
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,750
And this will actually have--
the tangents will actually

1314
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:56,590
match up here.

1315
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:58,880
So they will perfectly
mean in the center

1316
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,310
without self-intersection.

1317
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:03,110
So it's only sort of
a vertex unfolding.

1318
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:04,680
Because they're only
connected at the single point.

1319
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,210
But that's maybe necessary.

1320
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:07,202
I don't know.

1321
01:00:07,202 --> 01:00:08,910
And again, these are
the stretched paths.

1322
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:12,040

1323
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,950
It's a neat way to
think about unfolding.

1324
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:19,660
You can draw these--
ignore the yellow for now.

1325
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:22,234
That's if you might want
to actually cut these out.

1326
01:00:22,234 --> 01:00:24,150
So we have the three
petal unfolding, the four

1327
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:26,270
petal unfolding, five
petal unfolding, six petal,

1328
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:28,420
you can go arbitrarily high.

1329
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:32,110
In the limit, the
area of the blue stuff

1330
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:34,820
will converge to 4pi.

1331
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,779
This is another way to
get arbitrarily close.

1332
01:00:36,779 --> 01:00:38,320
Because the smaller
these things are,

1333
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,445
the less you're distorting.

1334
01:00:39,445 --> 01:00:43,180

1335
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,030
So this is two
families of wrappings.

1336
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:47,600
We call these-- the blue
stuff is the petal unfolding,

1337
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:51,550
the yellow is the convex
hull of the petal unfoldings.

1338
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:53,260
Not quite, actually.

1339
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:59,590
So in the case of k equals 3,
we could think about a convex

1340
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:01,610
hull, but what I've drawn
here is the smallest

1341
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:04,380
enclosing equilateral triangle.

1342
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,560
Now this is the first
class of unfoldings

1343
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:10,190
we came up with after
the obvious sphere--

1344
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:16,360
or circular one which
had pi cubed over 9pi.

1345
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:20,590
One thing we wondered
is that triangle,

1346
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:26,050
is it better than the
Mozart Kugel wrappings?

1347
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:28,136
Or is it worse?

1348
01:01:28,136 --> 01:01:29,510
One way or the
other, presumably.

1349
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:30,790
Or maybe it's the same again.

1350
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:32,780
Who knows.

1351
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:33,280
Let's see.

1352
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,101

1353
01:01:36,101 --> 01:01:36,600
Yeah.

1354
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:40,124
Let me tell you, at this point--
so I need more techniques

1355
01:01:40,124 --> 01:01:41,540
to cover both of
those unfoldings,

1356
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:46,480
but that square is
the first wrapping.

1357
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:47,774
This one.

1358
01:01:47,774 --> 01:01:49,940
I'll have to unfold another
one just so you can see.

1359
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:53,202

1360
01:01:53,202 --> 01:01:54,140
All right.

1361
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:57,010
So you see-- I mean,
I did a few times

1362
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:58,500
so maybe you already know.

1363
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,390
Here I have four corners,
four right angles.

1364
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:03,610
They meet at the top.

1365
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:06,820
So that is-- that's
where the four

1366
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:08,320
corners of the
square which are also

1367
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:11,480
the four corners of the
petal come together.

1368
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:15,500
And then it's just
everything-- these lines

1369
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,980
are stretched paths.

1370
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:19,830
There's no distortion around
them, they just kind of unfold.

1371
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:25,510
The stuff in the middle is--
it's like undressing here.

1372
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:27,390
It's so tantalizing.

1373
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:30,620
The stuff in the middle
is getting contracted.

1374
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:33,360
So if-- I don't know if you
could see, maybe in the video

1375
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,540
you'll be able to see.

1376
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:36,400
Look closely at here.

1377
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,450
Along this path there
isn't so much crinkling.

1378
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:42,170
In between there's a
lot more crinkling.

1379
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:43,490
It's like here there's
a lot of crinkling.

1380
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:44,960
When I unfold it,
a lot more stuff

1381
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,621
happens in between
the four top paths.

1382
01:02:48,621 --> 01:02:49,120
OK?

1383
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:52,660
Now, they wanted to
cut very simple shapes.

1384
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:54,820
In particular, shapes
that tiled the plane.

1385
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:58,920
So they ended up using squares
instead of the sort of optimal

1386
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:02,055
with that stretched paths
which are those four petals.

1387
01:03:02,055 --> 01:03:04,622

1388
01:03:04,622 --> 01:03:06,580
So they used the yellow,
whereas you could just

1389
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:07,270
get away with the blue.

1390
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:09,395
Of course, you want to add
a little bit of material

1391
01:03:09,395 --> 01:03:12,180
in the center so it
doesn't fall apart.

1392
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:14,540
And you need to thicken
the edges a little bit.

1393
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:19,240
So they care about that little
yellow minus blue savings?

1394
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,556
I'm not sure.

1395
01:03:20,556 --> 01:03:23,830
But what about the triangle?

1396
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:26,480
We spend a lot of time
computing these shapes.

1397
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,300
It's some weird trigonometry.

1398
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,860
It's in the notes.

1399
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:33,040
Arc sine of sine over square
root of 1 over sine squared

1400
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,750
minus cos squared of
various parameters

1401
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:38,935
is the description of
one of these curves.

1402
01:03:38,935 --> 01:03:40,560
So we did all this
computation and then

1403
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:44,180
we integrated it to compute
what these areas were and then--

1404
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:47,190
or figure out exactly what these
shapes were, take the tangents,

1405
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:50,280
say, well, is the smallest
enclosing triangle better

1406
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,440
or worse than the square?

1407
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:58,045
It turns out it's
better by 0.1%.

1408
01:03:58,045 --> 01:04:02,120

1409
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:05,280
Now, I think-- millions
of Mozart Kugel

1410
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,930
are made every year.

1411
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:12,700
0.1% could equate
to huge savings.

1412
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:14,290
Dollars.

1413
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:16,210
But just think of
the material wastage

1414
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:20,330
that Furst is committing
by using the square.

1415
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:22,590
If they used the
triangle instead,

1416
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:25,330
I mean, this could
solve global warming.

1417
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:27,065
This could solve
chocolate melting.

1418
01:04:27,065 --> 01:04:31,080

1419
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,730
We actually talk about global
warming in the paper as a joke.

1420
01:04:33,730 --> 01:04:36,330
It's a very funny paper.

1421
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:38,940
Very silly paper, I should say.

1422
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:39,440
Right.

1423
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,815
Let me tell you
another wrapping.

1424
01:04:40,815 --> 01:04:51,510

1425
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:52,930
Chalk.

1426
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:53,940
The comb wrapping.

1427
01:04:53,940 --> 01:05:04,510

1428
01:05:04,510 --> 01:05:07,430
Comb wrapping, we're going
to use the same idea.

1429
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:10,230
Again-- do I really
want to draw this again?

1430
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:14,325

1431
01:05:14,325 --> 01:05:19,170
I'm going to draw those petals,
but instead of connecting them

1432
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:21,110
at the north pole, we're
going to connect them

1433
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:22,850
along the equator.

1434
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:25,602
This is actually what
happens-- oh, no.

1435
01:05:25,602 --> 01:05:28,060
This is not-- this connects
them at the north pole I guess,

1436
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:29,340
and it folds them in half.

1437
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:30,850
Whatever.

1438
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:34,560
But I have the equator
nicely denoted here.

1439
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:38,580
So I want to keep the equator
as a new stretched path.

1440
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:41,000
I want that to unfold straight.

1441
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,330
But then attached to
it perpendicularly

1442
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:46,190
are all these
petals which unfold.

1443
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:51,900
So the result looks like this.

1444
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:56,650
Here's the equatorial stretched
path and here are the petals.

1445
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:59,320
Petals are exactly the
same shapes as before,

1446
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,740
so we still have stretched
pads perpendicular like that.

1447
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:04,450
But it's a new way
to cover every point

1448
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:06,840
on the sphere with
stretched paths.

1449
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,870
It leads to the blue unfoldings.

1450
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:11,480
You can take the smallest
enclosing rectangle

1451
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:12,576
and you get the yellow.

1452
01:06:12,576 --> 01:06:16,524

1453
01:06:16,524 --> 01:06:17,940
What do I want to
say about these?

1454
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:21,590

1455
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:24,070
They're the same
area, of course.

1456
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:29,295
They look a lot like these
old cartograms, cartographs--

1457
01:06:29,295 --> 01:06:33,700
whatever you call them--
unfoldings of the earth.

1458
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:34,910
I thought I brought an earth.

1459
01:06:34,910 --> 01:06:36,580
Maybe we didn't bring the earth.

1460
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:39,849
A globe, that is.

1461
01:06:39,849 --> 01:06:41,390
You've seen pictures
maybe like this.

1462
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:42,950
They're not unfolded
in the same way.

1463
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:45,580
They don't have stretched
paths that are perpendicular.

1464
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:47,750
They use some other
projection, so their petals

1465
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:49,150
are a different shape.

1466
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:51,310
And I'm not sure that
they're contractive--

1467
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:53,820
or inverse contractive maps.

1468
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:55,310
But same spirit anyway.

1469
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:58,040

1470
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:58,540
Let's see.

1471
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:01,630

1472
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:09,910
This one is the
Mirabell unfolding.

1473
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:13,750
Should I unfold another
just to illustrate?

1474
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:15,450
Going through chocolate
like crazy here.

1475
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:18,680
This is the really
hard one to unfold.

1476
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:22,087
So here's one corner--
a little hard to see.

1477
01:07:22,087 --> 01:07:23,420
Where's the equator going to be?

1478
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:26,770
I think the equator
is around here.

1479
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:28,190
That make sense?

1480
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:28,690
No.

1481
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:31,710
Actually it should be
perpendicular to that.

1482
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:34,119
Around here.

1483
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:35,410
This is a little harder to see.

1484
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:39,100

1485
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:40,850
Here's a corner, actually.

1486
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:42,687
Tucked inside.

1487
01:07:42,687 --> 01:07:44,520
I've been really curious
what kind of robots

1488
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:45,741
they have to do this.

1489
01:07:45,741 --> 01:07:46,240
All right.

1490
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,031
Here's the equator.

1491
01:07:47,031 --> 01:07:48,070
Now I can see it.

1492
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:49,920
So this-- the long
edge of the rectangle

1493
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,900
is wrapped around the equator.

1494
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,460
See it come off?

1495
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:57,220
And then the corners
are wrapped up

1496
01:07:57,220 --> 01:08:01,630
against-- so there's
two-- well, yeah,

1497
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:04,310
these guys go on one side,
these guys go on the other.

1498
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:06,360
That's the short edge
of the rectangle.

1499
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:09,080
Now we can actually compute how
big these things are, right?

1500
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:14,280
So the-- where's the-- I
have a page about this.

1501
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,649
Not much.

1502
01:08:16,649 --> 01:08:21,880
The vertical length,
that is one half equator.

1503
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,660
So that's pi.

1504
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:27,540
The horizontal length is 2pi.

1505
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:36,490
So this is Mirabell
rectangle, pi by 2pi.

1506
01:08:36,490 --> 01:08:40,540
And we talked about
the Furst wrapping

1507
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:52,100
which, let's see, this length--
so this goes like this.

1508
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:54,590
So this is 2pi, right?

1509
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:57,149
The diagonal is 2pi.

1510
01:08:57,149 --> 01:09:01,380
So that means this edge
length is root 2pi.

1511
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:01,939
By root 2pi.

1512
01:09:01,939 --> 01:09:04,859

1513
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:08,279
And magically-- I don't
really have a great reason why

1514
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:10,439
this should be the case
but-- well, maybe I

1515
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:13,260
do-- but these
have the same area.

1516
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:14,290
Both 2pi squared.

1517
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:16,910

1518
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:18,979
Which is like 6pi.

1519
01:09:18,979 --> 01:09:23,189
So better than 9ish pi, but
still not quite as good as

1520
01:09:23,189 --> 01:09:25,750
4ish pi.

1521
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:28,710
I have some exact numbers.

1522
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:32,100
More exact numbers?

1523
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,720
Oh, I have the perimeters.

1524
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:38,670
So the first wrapping, the
perimeter is 5.7 times pi.

1525
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:41,040
And the Mirabell
wrapping is 6 times pi.

1526
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,915
So reasonable
savings in perimeter.

1527
01:09:42,915 --> 01:09:45,930

1528
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:47,910
2pi squared.

1529
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:51,859
The equilateral
triangle wrapping--

1530
01:09:51,859 --> 01:09:55,210
that one in the top left--
instead of 2pi squared,

1531
01:09:55,210 --> 01:10:00,310
it has area 1.9983pi squared.

1532
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:05,930
That's the 0.1% improvement.

1533
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:07,387
Amazing.

1534
01:10:07,387 --> 01:10:08,220
This was a surprise.

1535
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:10,100
We thought it'd be a fair
amount better or worse

1536
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:11,141
or the same or something.

1537
01:10:11,141 --> 01:10:12,640
But almost the same.

1538
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,600
It's not what we expected.

1539
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,180
Let's see.

1540
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:21,790
I want to go to packing.

1541
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:24,800
What if you want to do better
than those simple convex

1542
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:25,300
shapes?

1543
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:28,200
Yeah, equilateral triangles and
squares and rectangles pack.

1544
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:31,300
But what if I tried to-- what
if I allowed non-convex shapes?

1545
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:34,540
I still want to tile
the plane, so I'm

1546
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:36,490
going to lose some
material for that.

1547
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:38,820
I could add some of this
material to the blue guy, some

1548
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:41,250
to the purple, some to the red.

1549
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:43,480
You can compute the
area of this thing

1550
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:46,280
and it does a lot better than
the equilateral triangle even.

1551
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,690
So now we're getting down there.

1552
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:51,140
The perimeter goes up a
little bit, but not by much.

1553
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:57,190
Packing three petals gives
1.6 times pi squared.

1554
01:10:57,190 --> 01:10:57,860
Getting better.

1555
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:00,740
By the way, 4pi-- because I'm
going to speak in pi squareds

1556
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:07,550
now-- 4pi is about
1.27pi squared.

1557
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:08,050
OK.

1558
01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:10,120
So what we want
is 1.27pi squared.

1559
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:16,090
At this point, we're at
1.6033 times pi squared.

1560
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:19,320
The comb does better.

1561
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:23,030
In the limit, you don't
lose zero here in the limit,

1562
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:25,810
but you lose quite little.

1563
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:29,340
In the limit you get
1.333 times pi squared.

1564
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:30,589
Versus 1.27.

1565
01:11:30,589 --> 01:11:31,380
That's pretty good.

1566
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:35,330
I think this is-- this is
what we should manufacture.

1567
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:35,830
Maybe.

1568
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:39,440
Of course, the perimeter
goes to infinity also.

1569
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,430
Slight problem.

1570
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:41,747
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1571
01:11:41,747 --> 01:11:43,580
PROFESSOR: You don't
lose zero in the limit.

1572
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:44,840
For awhile we thought we did.

1573
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,090
You'll have to think about it.

1574
01:11:46,090 --> 01:11:46,798
It's not obvious.

1575
01:11:46,798 --> 01:11:49,260

1576
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:51,130
Really, we have this
two dimensional space.

1577
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:53,900
It's called the
Pareto curve or-- it's

1578
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:57,170
a plot of perimeter on
the x-axis versus area

1579
01:11:57,170 --> 01:11:57,850
on the y-axis.

1580
01:11:57,850 --> 01:11:59,270
We want both to be small.

1581
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:01,970

1582
01:12:01,970 --> 01:12:04,169
So two-source
wrapping, for example,

1583
01:12:04,169 --> 01:12:05,460
is pretty good in both metrics.

1584
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:07,835
That's where you take the
Voronoi diagram, both the north

1585
01:12:07,835 --> 01:12:09,420
and south pole.

1586
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:11,560
So you actually
have two disks-- one

1587
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,370
for the southern hemisphere, one
for the northern hemisphere--

1588
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:18,860
you get two disks and you
just attach them side by side.

1589
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:22,190
Although-- yeah.

1590
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:22,690
Let's see.

1591
01:12:22,690 --> 01:12:24,440
What's this one?

1592
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,820
There's the Furst wrapping.

1593
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:27,694
So they're really good
in terms of perimeter.

1594
01:12:27,694 --> 01:12:30,260
In fact, one of the
best perimeters we know.

1595
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:33,070
It's an open problem
how far left you can go.

1596
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:38,210
The stars are convex
hull of petal wrappings.

1597
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:41,040
Because the square was a convex
hull of a four petal wrapping.

1598
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,020
This is the convex of
the three petal wrapping.

1599
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:45,380
Now, that doesn't
actually tile, but it

1600
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:46,844
has the smallest
perimeter we now.

1601
01:12:46,844 --> 01:12:48,510
So it's where you
take the three petals,

1602
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:50,301
but instead of completing
it to a triangle,

1603
01:12:50,301 --> 01:12:54,270
you actually make the sharp
turn around the petal.

1604
01:12:54,270 --> 01:13:02,290
So we have three
petals like this.

1605
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:04,960
And so the convex hull
is some tangent here.

1606
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,332
And then you follow
the petal for awhile.

1607
01:13:07,332 --> 01:13:09,040
And then you take a
tangent, and then you

1608
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:12,050
follow the petal for a while,
and then you take a tangent.

1609
01:13:12,050 --> 01:13:17,530
So that's the smallest
perimeter unfolding of a sphere

1610
01:13:17,530 --> 01:13:18,950
that we know.

1611
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:19,550
Open problem.

1612
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:20,690
Can you do better?

1613
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:22,670
Can you get arbitrarily small?

1614
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:24,620
Probably not.

1615
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:26,300
Some isoperimetry problem.

1616
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,560
You can get arbitrarily
low area, arbitrarily

1617
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,600
close to the optimal of 4pi.

1618
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,270
That's like the strip wrapping.

1619
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:36,730
Let's see.

1620
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:38,060
So that's one limit.

1621
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:41,000
That corresponds to the limit
of petal or comb wrappings.

1622
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,250
Petal and comb wrappings,
if you don't take any hulls

1623
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:47,140
or anything, they are the same
area and the same perimeter.

1624
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:49,230
So I think out of
that you should

1625
01:13:49,230 --> 01:13:51,650
be able to see why, in the
special case of the square

1626
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:53,400
and the rectangle, you
get the same stuff.

1627
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:57,250
There's a bijection
between all the parts.

1628
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:58,150
Not totally obvious.

1629
01:13:58,150 --> 01:14:01,360
You have to dissect
a little bit.

1630
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,730
Mirabell wrappings,
they're not so good.

1631
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:04,390
What are those?

1632
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:07,380
The convex hull
of comb wrappings.

1633
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:08,380
So they're way out here.

1634
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:11,570
Clearly Furst is better.

1635
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:14,020
Here's the equilateral
triangle, which you can't tell,

1636
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:18,040
but it's slightly
below that dashed line.

1637
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:21,212
And pretty good perimeter but
not quite as good as Furst.

1638
01:14:21,212 --> 01:14:23,670
So actually, probably, you
don't want to use the triangles.

1639
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:25,490
You prefer the lower perimeter.

1640
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:27,590
But this guy is interesting.

1641
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:29,050
Anyway, this is a fun space.

1642
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:31,235
What we kind of really
care about is-- this

1643
01:14:31,235 --> 01:14:32,360
is called the Pareto curve.

1644
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:35,240
It's the, if I give you some
bound on perimeter, what's

1645
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,260
the smallest area I can get?

1646
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,040
This is the best
bound we know so far.

1647
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:42,060
And we know the Pareto
curves below this thing,

1648
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:43,980
but can you go lower?

1649
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,060
We don't know.

1650
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:48,050
So these are some fun examples,
but actually, the big questions

1651
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:50,550
are still pretty
much unsolved here.

1652
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:52,830
Even if you restrict
to-- I think

1653
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:56,200
it's fair to restrict to
wrappings of the sphere

1654
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,960
where every point
on the sphere gets

1655
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:01,350
covered by a stretched path.

1656
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:07,780
That seems like a nice,
natural class to think about.

1657
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:11,990

1658
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:15,140
But we have no idea what
that hull space looks like.

1659
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:18,670
Can you do better than
these particular attempts?

1660
01:15:18,670 --> 01:15:20,640
Looks like we're
doing pretty good,

1661
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,490
but we don't even know
how far left you can go.

1662
01:15:23,490 --> 01:15:24,910
So a pretty neat question.

1663
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:26,290
And that is Mozart Kugel.

1664
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:29,130
Any questions?

1665
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:32,058
Other than, can I have some?

1666
01:15:32,058 --> 01:15:33,450
AUDIENCE: Where can we get some?

1667
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:35,372
PROFESSOR: Where
can you get some.

1668
01:15:35,372 --> 01:15:36,330
That's a good question.

1669
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:40,106
Most European airports
sell Mirabell.

1670
01:15:40,106 --> 01:15:42,480
So if you're flying through
Europe, it's the place to go.

1671
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:45,920
Does anyone know if you
can get them locally?

1672
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,987
I think maybe.

1673
01:15:47,987 --> 01:15:49,450
AUDIENCE: I think Cardullo's.

1674
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:51,220
PROFESSOR: Cardullo's
that's a good place.

1675
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:51,920
In Harvard Square.

1676
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,350
They have a lot of
imported chocolates.

1677
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:54,880
So, yeah, I think
they have Mirabell.

1678
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:55,355
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1679
01:15:55,355 --> 01:15:57,730
There's a lot of imported
chocolates and confectioneries

1680
01:15:57,730 --> 01:15:59,260
in the Pru.

1681
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:00,760
PROFESSOR: In the
Prudential Center.

1682
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:01,700
All right.

1683
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:04,100
These I think you have
to go to Salzburg.

1684
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:06,090
Even in Austria
they're hard to get.

1685
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:07,962
So these are very special.

1686
01:16:07,962 --> 01:16:11,691
I'll give Marty my second one.

1687
01:16:11,691 --> 01:16:12,190
All right.

1688
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:13,617
That's all for today.

1689
01:16:13,617 --> 01:16:16,200
Hey, there's one thing I forgot
to talk about in lecture which

1690
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,658
I think is really
cool so I'm going

1691
01:16:17,658 --> 01:16:21,600
to add a little bit to
what we were talking about.

1692
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,340
We have all these
wrappings of the sphere

1693
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:25,850
but I never proved to that
they're actually contractive.

1694
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:31,290
How do you prove that all those
wrappings are contractive?

1695
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:36,120
Well, there's a cool theorem we
proved just for this purpose.

1696
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:44,555
I'll call it the Cauchy Arm
Lemma on a growing sphere.

1697
01:16:44,555 --> 01:16:47,630

1698
01:16:47,630 --> 01:16:49,942
It's a nice little connection
to Cauchy's Arm Lemma

1699
01:16:49,942 --> 01:16:55,430
which we talked about in the
context of Cauchy's rigidity

1700
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:58,420
theorem for polyhedral.

1701
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:00,130
Now, remember,
Cauchy's Arm Lemma

1702
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:04,480
is about you have
some convex chain--

1703
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:08,760
and actually it applies both
on the plane and the sphere.

1704
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,320
So we're thinking
of an open chain

1705
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,653
but we had the property that
even if you add the closing

1706
01:17:12,653 --> 01:17:14,470
edge it's convex.

1707
01:17:14,470 --> 01:17:17,020
And then we looked at
a flex of the chain

1708
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:20,000
where all of the
angles increased

1709
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,420
and we said, if all
the angles increase,

1710
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:25,176
then this distance
increases, the endpoint--

1711
01:17:25,176 --> 01:17:27,050
the distance between
the endpoints increases.

1712
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:30,300
That's regular
Cauchy's Arm Lemma.

1713
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:33,930
But now I want to look at
not growing the angles,

1714
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:38,090
but growing the sphere
that the linkage lives on.

1715
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:40,140
So think of this in
the spherical case,

1716
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:46,070
which we'll-- imagine this
thing is on a sphere and now I

1717
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:51,530
transform it by taking a
larger sphere, larger radius,

1718
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:55,400
and drawing exactly the same
edge lengths and angles.

1719
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,100
Here, I'll draw it
a little bit curved

1720
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:03,210
because in reality these
edges are great circular arcs.

1721
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:06,300
So this edge length here
matches this length,

1722
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:09,490
this angle matches this
angle, this edge length

1723
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:11,850
matches this edge
length, and so on.

1724
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:15,180
But I draw it on
a bigger sphere.

1725
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:19,340
This theorem says, that the
distance between the endpoints

1726
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:22,780
will increase also in that case.

1727
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:25,000
So that's kind of neat.

1728
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:30,140
And in the limit, if you take a
ginormous sphere, all the way--

1729
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:34,670
if you take a really, really
big sphere, it becomes a plane.

1730
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:36,480
So if I take
something on a sphere

1731
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:42,410
and then I actually draw it on
the plane with the same angle--

1732
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:46,190
so this planar angle
matches this spherical angle

1733
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:49,770
and this length matches this
spherical length-- then,

1734
01:18:49,770 --> 01:18:52,810
in particular, this
distance will increase.

1735
01:18:52,810 --> 01:18:56,960
And in the reverse, if I
take a planar convex chain

1736
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:01,120
and I redraw it on some
sphere, the distance

1737
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:04,570
will go down provided
this thing is also convex.

1738
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:06,750
So that's the Lemma.

1739
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:09,382
Now, let me show you
how to use that to prove

1740
01:19:09,382 --> 01:19:11,090
that all those wrappings
are contractive.

1741
01:19:11,090 --> 01:19:13,740

1742
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:15,573
It's really easy once
you have this Lemma.

1743
01:19:15,573 --> 01:19:18,580

1744
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:20,445
Let's start with
the source wrapping.

1745
01:19:20,445 --> 01:19:26,180

1746
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:29,070
So remember, we had a
sphere, the north pole,

1747
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:32,840
and we took all these shortest
paths from the north pole

1748
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:33,790
to the south pole.

1749
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:38,840
All of those lines-- I want
to claim that-- and when

1750
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:42,500
you unfold this you get a really
big disk and all those lines

1751
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,930
become straight.

1752
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:48,050
So what I need to show is that
between every pair of points,

1753
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:53,002
the distance decreases when
I go from flat to sphere.

1754
01:19:53,002 --> 01:19:54,710
Which is exactly what
happened over here.

1755
01:19:54,710 --> 01:19:59,000
I went from flat to the sphere,
this distance decreased.

1756
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,720
So that's how it's
going to be useful.

1757
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:06,180
If I take two points, like,
say, this point and this point.

1758
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:07,210
Any two points.

1759
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:13,440
They live on one of these
spokes that goes to the center.

1760
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,540
So draw those two
segments to the center

1761
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:16,840
which was the north pole here.

1762
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:20,240
So if I take the corresponding
two points up here,

1763
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:24,190
I'm looking at that
path and that path.

1764
01:20:24,190 --> 01:20:27,646
Well, that's a convex chain
and the distance between them--

1765
01:20:27,646 --> 01:20:30,760
between those two points that
I started with, say, x and y,

1766
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:35,770
is exactly the closing
distance of that convex chain.

1767
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:38,150
So here's a convex chain,
it matches the angles

1768
01:20:38,150 --> 01:20:40,700
and the lengths of this
convex chain and the plane.

1769
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:44,660
Therefore, this distance is
larger than this distance.

1770
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:46,480
And so this is a
contractive map because it

1771
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,740
works for any two
points x and y.

1772
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:50,650
So that's the source wrapping.

1773
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:53,970
With slightly more effort,
slightly more interesting

1774
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:59,050
example, is the petal wrappings.

1775
01:20:59,050 --> 01:21:01,365
So think about one petal.

1776
01:21:01,365 --> 01:21:03,910

1777
01:21:03,910 --> 01:21:08,050
So let's say I just take-- in
fact, just think about half

1778
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:09,920
of a petal.

1779
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:13,740
So we had a petal look
something like that

1780
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:16,460
going to the south pole here.

1781
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:22,840
And so we bisected this thing
and then we took lots of ribs

1782
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:23,770
like that.

1783
01:21:23,770 --> 01:21:25,080
So that's one half petal.

1784
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:29,110

1785
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:32,260
So when you unfold,
it looks like this.

1786
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:34,960

1787
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,390
Take any two points
on the half petal.

1788
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:40,420
I'll show, first of all, that
the half petal is contractive.

1789
01:21:40,420 --> 01:21:44,210
So I take two points, say,
this one and this one,

1790
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:46,670
call them x and y.

1791
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:51,600
Now I take this rib,
this rib and this rib.

1792
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,450
Those are the
stretched paths again.

1793
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:56,620
They map to whatever up here.

1794
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:59,380
Again, it's a
convex chain and so

1795
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:02,260
this distance increases
when you go to the sphere

1796
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:05,350
because it's convex
in both scenarios.

1797
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:06,300
So that's half petals.

1798
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:08,330
Now, when you worry
about a full petal

1799
01:22:08,330 --> 01:22:10,538
and you want to show the
whole wrapping is expansive,

1800
01:22:10,538 --> 01:22:14,440
you actually use a
different method.

1801
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:17,350
So let's say we take
a whole petal here.

1802
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:20,010

1803
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:22,380
And I want to show not
only any pair of points

1804
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:26,870
within a single half petal
contract but, in fact,

1805
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:29,940
any two vertices, any
two points contract.

1806
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:32,690
So I'm going to take x
and some other point.

1807
01:22:32,690 --> 01:22:34,500
Now I'll call it z.

1808
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:37,860
If I did the-- just looked
at the stretched paths,

1809
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:39,060
that's no longer convex.

1810
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:40,600
I can't use the same trick.

1811
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,900
But here's a new trick.

1812
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:46,575
I take a straight line, a
shortest path from x to z,

1813
01:22:46,575 --> 01:22:50,070
which gives me a new
point y in the middle.

1814
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:52,570
Now I know that this
distance contracts

1815
01:22:52,570 --> 01:22:55,200
because that's within
a single half petal.

1816
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,590
So by the previous
argument, and by looking

1817
01:22:57,590 --> 01:23:01,320
at that little chain, I
know by this Arm Lemma

1818
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:04,330
that distance contracts, I know
that this distance contracts.

1819
01:23:04,330 --> 01:23:06,340
So what about the
whole distance?

1820
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:09,480
Well, if I look at the
distance from x to z--

1821
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:15,290
that's what I care about--
let's say, in the plane,

1822
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:17,960
this equals the sum
of those distances.

1823
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,710
Because we drew a
straight line, it

1824
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:22,900
equals the distance from x to y
plus the distance from y to z.

1825
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:25,860

1826
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:28,520
Now, I mapped these
onto the sphere,

1827
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:32,040
call that d prime is
the spherical distance.

1828
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:34,820
I know that when I look
at d prime I contract.

1829
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:38,830
So d prime of xy is going
to be smaller for xy,

1830
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:42,500
it's going to be smaller for yz.

1831
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,430
What I really care
about is the distance

1832
01:23:44,430 --> 01:23:47,300
of the sphere between x and z.

1833
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:50,340
But this is the
triangle inequality.

1834
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:57,070
If you have a triangle xyz,
the distance from x to z

1835
01:23:57,070 --> 01:23:59,600
is always, at most,
the distance from x

1836
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,480
to y plus the
distance from y to z.

1837
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:03,341
That holds in any metric space.

1838
01:24:03,341 --> 01:24:05,090
So, in particular, it
holds on the sphere.

1839
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:06,214
So this is sort of trivial.

1840
01:24:06,214 --> 01:24:08,050
This is triangle inequality.

1841
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:12,450
And this was the contractiveness
that we already prove.

1842
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:13,750
And this is just equal.

1843
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:15,560
And so we get that
the new distance

1844
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:18,050
is a contraction of
the old distance.

1845
01:24:18,050 --> 01:24:19,610
So that works on a full petal.

1846
01:24:19,610 --> 01:24:21,650
It actually-- this
exact same technique

1847
01:24:21,650 --> 01:24:24,540
works if you have a
full petal unfolding.

1848
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:26,940
Maybe you have
something like this.

1849
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:32,670
And you take-- finish it off--
you take two points anywhere

1850
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:35,730
on any two petals,
like here and here, you

1851
01:24:35,730 --> 01:24:38,440
take the shortest
path between them

1852
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,320
and again, you
could argue, well,

1853
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:43,515
this is going to contract
because it is in a single half

1854
01:24:43,515 --> 01:24:45,390
petal, this is going to
contract because it's

1855
01:24:45,390 --> 01:24:46,650
in a single have petal.

1856
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:49,270
Therefore, that sum
will also contract

1857
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:51,130
by exactly the same argument.

1858
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:53,460
And you can use that for
the comb wrapping too.

1859
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:55,370
This is kind of neat
with this little Lemma

1860
01:24:55,370 --> 01:24:58,870
about growing spheres and
showing the distances increase,

1861
01:24:58,870 --> 01:25:01,380
you get to prove that all of
these wrappings are contractive

1862
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:03,254
and therefore all these
things I was claiming

1863
01:25:03,254 --> 01:25:04,590
were working really do work.

1864
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:08,670
You can formalize that
in a simple little way.
