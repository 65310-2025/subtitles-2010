0-1:59:59,500 --> 00:00:03,820

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,470
PROFESSOR: All right, welcome.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:10,130
We have some fun origami
topics today, mostly

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,215
related to a topic
called pleat folding.

5
00:00:12,215 --> 00:00:21,830

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,749
General idea of pleat
folding is to fold

7
00:00:24,749 --> 00:00:26,790
alternating mountains and
valleys back and forth.

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,330

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,760
And you can do a lot of cool
things with pleat folding,

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,720
and that's what I want
to talk about today.

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,630
In particular, this
model is usually

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,660
called the hyperbolic
paraboloid.

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,150
It's pretty simple.

14
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,680
You start with a square paper.

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,660
You fold this crease
pattern, which

16
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,860
is concentric squares
alternating mountain

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,080
and valley, and you
fold the diagonals,

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,600
alternating mountain and valley.

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,975
You crush it all
together, you'll

20
00:00:54,975 --> 00:00:56,380
get this sort of x-shape.

21
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,960
And you sort of let
go, give it a twist,

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,760
and it pops into this
saddle form, which

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,245
looks a lot like a
hyperbolic paraboloid, which

24
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:12,400
is one of the standard
saddle surfaces.

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,360
It's approximating a hyperbolic
paraboloid, we think,

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,762
or we thought, and that's
why it's called that.

27
00:01:19,762 --> 00:01:21,220
So you should all
try this at home.

28
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,011
It's a great model.

29
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:22,722
It's very cool.

30
00:01:22,722 --> 00:01:24,180
It's an example of
something I like

31
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,390
to call self-folding origami
because the paper basically

32
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,170
folds itself.

33
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,730
You put in a very simple crease
pattern, concentric squares.

34
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,280
What could be simpler than that?

35
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,630
And yet you get this really
cool 3D form automatically.

36
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:43,570
Physics, in some sense, is
finding this form for us.

37
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,980
You can take this
pleating idea and apply it

38
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,480
to many different
crease patterns.

39
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,300
Another fun one if you have
a compass lying around,

40
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,500
to score circles is you just
crease concentric circles,

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,127
alternating mountain and valley.

42
00:01:57,127 --> 00:01:58,710
In this case, you
also need to cut out

43
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,050
a circular hole in the center.

44
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,670
Then you get a
different saddle form,

45
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,590
which we don't know
exactly what it is.

46
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:15,230
Let's see, I have some various
fun things to talk about here.

47
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:20,290
So what's going on with paper--
if I take a piece of paper,

48
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,760
paper is an elastic material.

49
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,160
It remembers that
it was made flat.

50
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,360
It likes to be flat.

51
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,570
If I curl a paper a
little bit, for example,

52
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,390
it flattens back out.

53
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,460
That's elastic memory.

54
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,040
If however, I crease
a piece of paper,

55
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,760
then that's called a
plastic deformation

56
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,650
beyond the yield
point of the material.

57
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,689
This works in sheet metal
also, lots of materials.

58
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:49,730
I've effectively changed
the memory of the paper.

59
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,140
It now wants to stay bent.

60
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,120
If I try to unfold it, it
goes back to some angle.

61
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,930
Depending on how
hard I crease it,

62
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,020
it will go to a sharper angle.

63
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,920
So that's basically
what's going on.

64
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,910
In these surfaces, where
we crease the paper,

65
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,560
it wants to stay bent.

66
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,950
Where we don't crease the
paper, it wants to stay flat.

67
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,330
It can't do all of those
things, but physics

68
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,690
finds an equilibrium
among all those forces.

69
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,800
So we simulated
that some years ago.

70
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,350
This is with architecture
undergrad Jenna Fizel

71
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,700
and Professor John
Ochsendorf, architecture.

72
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,540
So on the right of
each of these examples,

73
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,270
we have photographs of real
models, pleated foldings,

74
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,590
a hyperbolic paraboloid,
squares, hexagon,

75
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,670
octagon, just not so pretty.

76
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:43,620
But we re-created that physical
model with a virtual model

77
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,250
just using some
spring approximation

78
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,630
to the forces I described.

79
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,880
And here's an approximation
to a circle, where we just

80
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,000
took a really big regular n-gon.

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,390
This is real circles
and the simulation.

82
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,520
So this confirms that what
I said is actually true.

83
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,580
Those are the only
forces you need to model,

84
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,490
and you get an
approximation of what

85
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,220
really happens in real life.

86
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,240
So instead of folding
real paper in this way,

87
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,160
you could simulate it.

88
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,120

89
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,680
Cool.

90
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,399
Here is that simulator in
action with pleated hexagons,

91
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,970
just to show you
what it looks like.

92
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,460
So the creases are trying
to become more bent,

93
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,460
at this point have
reached equilibrium,

94
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,850
and you get your 3D form.

95
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,570
Once you have that
3D form, so you

96
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,840
have a virtual model of a
physical piece of paper,

97
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,390
the natural thing to do
is build a physical model

98
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,570
of the virtual model of the
physical piece of paper.

99
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,790
And you've seen this
on the mailing list.

100
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,920
This is what we're
calling origami skeletons.

101
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,130
Here the vertices, which
you can see bigger here,

102
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,690
are 3D printed plastic spheres,
and there's aluminum rods.

103
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,280
The spheres have holes
at just the right angles

104
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,070
to make exactly the 3D form
that was made by that simulator.

105
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,480
So this is something you
could really only build

106
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,910
if you had a virtual
model of that thing.

107
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,882
So this is a fun example
of taking mathematics

108
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:12,840
and our sort of the
computational understanding

109
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,340
of how paper folds
and turning it

110
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:21,480
into sculpture that requires
that mathematical basis.

111
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,930
On the topic of sculpture,
at the very beginning--

112
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,750
so this is early on in my PhD,
with my dad and my PhD advisor

113
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:35,620
Anna Lubiw, same authors as
like the folding problem,

114
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,070
one of our early explorations on
the mathematical sculpture side

115
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,010
was to take
hyperbolic paraboloids

116
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,150
and take a lot of them
and join them together

117
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,370
to make polyhedral surfaces.

118
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,020
These are what we
call hyperhedra

119
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,790
because hyperbolic paraboloids
are also called hypars,

120
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,610
I think, originally by
the architect community.

121
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,650
So these are
algorithmically-generated

122
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,390
sculpture.

123
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,260
The input to the algorithm is
a polyhedron, like the cube,

124
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,910
and the output is a way
to join hypars together

125
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,550
to represent that cube.

126
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,160
And the algorithm
is very simple.

127
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,800
For each face of the
polyhedron-- so here it

128
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,720
has four sides, you take
four hyperbolic paraboloids

129
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,895
and join them together in a
cycle just sharing one edge.

130
00:06:18,895 --> 00:06:21,660

131
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,880
So you do that for each of
the six faces, so in all

132
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,340
you have 24 hyperbolic
paraboloids.

133
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,090
Then to join two
faces together, you

134
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,160
join them along a pair
of edges like this.

135
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,540
And when you do that,
you get an enclosure.

136
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,880
It's a closed solid.

137
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,380
And you can do that
for every-- here

138
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,170
we're doing it for all
the Platonic solids.

139
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,390
You can do it with any
polyhedron in theory.

140
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,676
So it's like an infinite
family of sculptures here,

141
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:47,620
which is kind of fun.

142
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,190

143
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,810
Here is a simulation of
that cube just for fun.

144
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,870
That works, too.

145
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,320

146
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,290
And back to the curve creases.

147
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,160
These are some examples I
showed way back in lecture 1.

148
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,880
These are sculptures in the
permanent collection at MOMA.

149
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,010
And the idea here
is instead of taking

150
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:15,100
just one concentric circle
which goes around 360 degrees,

151
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,000
we take a circular ramp
which goes around twice,

152
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and then join the ends.

153
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,550
So we have 720
degrees of material

154
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,390
there, which you might think
of as negative curvature.

155
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,569
But it's a little
weird because there's

156
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:28,860
the hole cut out in the center.

157
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,920
So it's a little hard
to measure curvature,

158
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,970
but you can actually define it.

159
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,810
And these are three
different foldings

160
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,290
with the same idea, slightly
different parameters

161
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:44,570
in how big those ramps are, and
different numbers of creases.

162
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,300
And you get very different
equilibrium forms.

163
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,020
Again, this all sort
of self-folding paper

164
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,180
wants to live in these
three configurations.

165
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,390
Here's some that you
may not have seen.

166
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,900
They're on the web.

167
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,220
But these are taking
regular 360-degree circles

168
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,600
but taking two or
three or four of them

169
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,180
and joining them at a
couple of key points,

170
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,680
and the rest is self-folding.

171
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:19,570
So the big-- I mean, the sort of
powerful scientific engineering

172
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,730
idea here is that you
could deploy complicated

173
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,560
3D structures just
by manufacturing

174
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,290
very simple flat
structures, maybe

175
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:31,050
joining a few points together,
and then just say go.

176
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,000
If you can manufacture
these things

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,350
so that every crease
locally wants to bend,

178
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,820
then you'll get these
3D forms automatically.

179
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,789
This is especially powerful
at the nano scale, where

180
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:43,800
you can't have your fingers
moving around and pressing

181
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,300
things.

182
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,280
But you can probably
use materials

183
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,570
that, say, when heated
or you add some chemical,

184
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,010
cause everything to fold.

185
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,930
It's very easy for us from
all the chip fabrication

186
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:59,960
we do to manufacture
flat crease patterns,

187
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,750
and that will let us manufacture
3D things at the nano scale.

188
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,610
You could also imagine it a
much larger scale like a space

189
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,100
station-- like a space
station that looks like that.

190
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,560
That would be pretty
cool-- and something

191
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,610
where you don't want
to have to physically

192
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,950
fold everything by hand.

193
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,950
But if it could be
done automatically,

194
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,990
life would be good.

195
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,429
Now, we don't have
any algorithms

196
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:22,970
for the reverse
engineering problem--

197
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,260
If I give you a 3D
curved surface like this,

198
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,960
find the crease pattern and
the joins that make it happen.

199
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,070
But that's the goal.

200
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,820
And towards that goal,
we make sculpture

201
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,751
to explore the space
of what you can make.

202
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:37,250
All right.

203
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:44,030
I think I have one more
sculptural example here,

204
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:49,740
which is combining these curve
creases with glassblowing.

205
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,620
And to make glassblowing
more tactical,

206
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,302
Marty here, our cameraman,
is blowing glass blindfold.

207
00:09:56,302 --> 00:09:57,260
Don't try this at home.

208
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:03,490

209
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,680
So paper folding is a
very tactile experience.

210
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,180
To make glassblowing more about
touching the material, which

211
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,650
you're not usually supposed
to do because it's over 1,000

212
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,260
degrees Fahrenheit-- blindfolds.

213
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,860

214
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,680
AUDIENCE: 1,000
degrees Centigrade.

215
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,510
PROFESSOR: 1,000
degrees centigrade.

216
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,520
Wow.

217
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,145
The temperature of
an erupting volcano.

218
00:10:24,145 --> 00:10:27,478
[MUSIC PLAYING]

219
00:10:27,478 --> 00:10:34,960

220
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:41,316
This is in the glassblowing
studio in 4.003 near here.

221
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:42,690
He's made a whole
bunch of those.

222
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,710
And here's what it looks like to
fold from scratch, so to speak,

223
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,400
a concentric circle model.

224
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,240
Of course, it's
accelerated in movie time.

225
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,100
It only takes 10 seconds.

226
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:59,820
In reality, it takes 10 minutes
after pre-scoring, maybe more.

227
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,920
And now we get some
ship-in-the-bottle action.

228
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,740

229
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,204
And this is a lot of fun
for us because not only

230
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:12,870
do you have the
self-folding constraint,

231
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,995
but you have this
enclosure constraint.

232
00:11:15,995 --> 00:11:17,610
These forms would
not look as exciting

233
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,026
if they could
sprawl out, and they

234
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:23,380
didn't have any constraints
to live inside these bubbles.

235
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,770
So you get yet
another collection

236
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:30,960
of forms from that glass.

237
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,634
All right.

238
00:11:31,634 --> 00:11:33,800
I think that's the end of
our little sculpture tour.

239
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,366
We'll come back to sculpture
at the end of this lecture.

240
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:39,240
But I want to talk more
about-- oh, question.

241
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,281
AUDIENCE: What was the
idea behind the blindfold?

242
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:43,880
PROFESSOR: What was the
idea behind the blindfold?

243
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,800
So paper folding is all
about touching material.

244
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,570
Glassblowing is
usually very visual.

245
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,900
It's about you look
at the material,

246
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,470
and you don't usually touch it.

247
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,580
So we wanted to unify the two
in order to put them together.

248
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,930
Plus it was just a crazy idea.

249
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,280
I think what happened
is I was in my office.

250
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,120
My dad calls me up.

251
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,911
He's blowing glass.

252
00:12:02,911 --> 00:12:04,390
He's like, I got
this great idea.

253
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,760
Come over with a camera.

254
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,760
So in that video, I
was the cameraman.

255
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,404
And I was like,
all right, you want

256
00:12:11,404 --> 00:12:12,695
to burn yourself blowing glass.

257
00:12:12,695 --> 00:12:14,028
He didn't actually burn himself.

258
00:12:14,028 --> 00:12:14,980
Usually, he does.

259
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,438
But blindfold, he
was more careful.

260
00:12:16,438 --> 00:12:19,805

261
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,260
Yeah, blindfold glassblowing,
it's pretty crazy.

262
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,460
That was his first
try ever blindfold

263
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,800
glassblowing in that video.

264
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,300
All right.

265
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,300
So this hyperbolic
paraboloid, it's

266
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,482
been around for a long time.

267
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:33,690
I didn't mention the history.

268
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,350
It goes back to the
Bauhaus in the late '20s.

269
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,610
Albers, who I'm sure
many of you know of,

270
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,280
taught a class about design.

271
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,130
And he liked using
paper as a material that

272
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,455
would force you to focus--
not worry about material

273
00:12:49,455 --> 00:12:53,000
in the sort of architectural
scale and what would stand up--

274
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,760
and just think about design.

275
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,500
And paper folding was really
tactile and good for that.

276
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,380
And I'm not sure exactly
whether it was him

277
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,430
or a student of his, it's
somebody in that period, 1927,

278
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:09,310
'28, came up with this
model and the circular one.

279
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,505
And then it's been taught
many times since then.

280
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:18,810
Then it really hit it big in the
origami community in the 1980s

281
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:23,260
by [INAUDIBLE], and since then
everybody's been folding it.

282
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:23,830
Question?

283
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:28,154
AUDIENCE: Is it not rigid,
but paper [INAUDIBLE]?

284
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:29,320
PROFESSOR: Ah, you made one.

285
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,760
Can I show it?

286
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,070

287
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:34,980
Thanks, [INAUDIBLE].

288
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,350
Simple little example, but
here is concentric squares,

289
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,990
and you crease it down.

290
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:47,260
Normally you get this
kind of X. You let go,

291
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,860
and it pops into
a little saddle.

292
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,800
So this is a sort of
low-resolution one.

293
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,010
If you spend twice
as much time, you

294
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,690
can double the
resolution and so on.

295
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,360
Your question, is it rigid?

296
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,230
Probably not rigid.

297
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,810
There's like this
degree of freedom.

298
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,831
AUDIENCE: Rigid in
the sense of that

299
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:06,394
between creases [INAUDIBLE].

300
00:14:06,394 --> 00:14:07,060
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

301
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,330
What's happening in
between the creases?

302
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,080
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

303
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,413
PROFESSOR: That is exactly
the topic of today's lecture.

304
00:14:13,413 --> 00:14:16,340
In fact, we have a paper called
"How Does Paper Fold Between

305
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,290
Creases" to address
exactly this question.

306
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,182
I'm going to hang
onto it, if you

307
00:14:19,182 --> 00:14:21,410
don't mind because it'll
be useful to point at.

308
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,280

309
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,610
In fact, it is
completely impossible

310
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,912
to fold that crease
pattern into this shape.

311
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:34,040
And so your idea that there's
something weird going on

312
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,480
is an idea-- we've
known for a long time

313
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,530
that these faces
could not stay planar.

314
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:43,670
I mean, at least visually it's
hard to see unless you stare

315
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,180
at it with all the right angles.

316
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,170
But the faces look
like they twist.

317
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:48,890
Now, that's OK.

318
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:53,270
Paper can do all sorts of
curving stuff without creasing.

319
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:58,040
I mean, this is sort of like
a twist, no creases involved.

320
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,020
So we thought this was
possible, but in fact, it's not.

321
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,280
So this is the big surprise.

322
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,960
It's something we
discovered just last year,

323
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,120
and I'm going to prove
that to you today.

324
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,360
So the theorem is, if I have
this concentric square crease

325
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,870
pattern, even ignoring
the mountains and valleys,

326
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,870
it is impossible to
fold that crease pattern

327
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,930
into anything that is not flat.

328
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,680
So you can, of course,
not fold it at all,

329
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,180
then none of the
creases get folded.

330
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,390
You can collapse it
all the way down.

331
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,110
That probably
isn't even allowed.

332
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,530
But never mind.

333
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,990
But what we really
want is a 3D form

334
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,340
where every crease is
bent by a non-zero angle

335
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,000
and also not by 180 degrees.

336
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,310
So we'll call that a
proper folding, something

337
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,354
where every crease is
strictly between 0 and 180,

338
00:15:44,354 --> 00:15:46,020
which is what we want
in these 3D forms.

339
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,120
And the theorem is,
that is impossible

340
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,060
for the hyperbolic paraboloid.

341
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,922
There is none.

342
00:15:51,922 --> 00:15:56,750

343
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,560
So that's weird because
we fold them all the time.

344
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,925
We've been folding
them for like 11 years,

345
00:16:01,925 --> 00:16:06,710
and other people have been
folding them for 80 years.

346
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,440
What's happening with
the real piece of paper?

347
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,810
Well, one possible answer
is that there's more creases

348
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,830
that you don't
see in this model.

349
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,910
And if you add
more creases, it is

350
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,090
possible to fold
something that looks

351
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,590
like a hyperbolic paraboloid.

352
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,460
So here we have the regular
crease pattern in black,

353
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,000
and then I've added
some purple diagonals.

354
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,270
Wherever we had a
black trapezoid,

355
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,410
I've added one purple
diagonal to triangulate

356
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,500
the crease pattern.

357
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,700
And here I've chosen what
seems to be an especially

358
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,200
good triangulation
where I zigzag

359
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,740
back and forth
within one quarter.

360
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:49,100
And then also from around a
ring, I zigzag back and forth.

361
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,870
So that triangulation
folds into this.

362
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,530
That's another theorem.

363
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,850
This is construction on a
computer, obviously, where

364
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:02,630
we have 16 rings, and
the central crease here

365
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:06,480
is folded by an
angle of 30 degrees.

366
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,339
That's the theta.

367
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:12,380
Notice I also had to
remove part of a diagonal.

368
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,119
That's also necessary.

369
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,670
In the center, you
can't crease both

370
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:21,990
of those, the folds in an
X, by a non-zero amount.

371
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,990
Those are all things we're
going to prove today.

372
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,371
But before we prove
the negative things,

373
00:17:26,371 --> 00:17:27,829
I want to prove
the positive thing,

374
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,420
that this thing can
actually be built.

375
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,820
That may seem obvious
because here it is.

376
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,440
I built one.

377
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,780
But because there's all these
arguments of, well, here it

378
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,510
is, I built one, we've got to
be especially careful about,

379
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:43,290
does this thing
really truly exist?

380
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,720
So let me tell you
how it's constructed

381
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,124
and how we can actually prove
not only can we build it

382
00:17:49,124 --> 00:17:51,540
approximately on a computer,
but we can prove there really

383
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,155
is one there even though
we don't have it exactly.

384
00:17:54,155 --> 00:17:56,800

385
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,420
So it's actually pretty
cool and pretty easy.

386
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:07,855
So this is the triangulated
hyperbolic paraboloid.

387
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:12,780

388
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,100
So the idea is to work
from the inside out.

389
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,640
We're going to start
with this central square

390
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:25,310
here-- and let me draw
it over here-- fold it

391
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,890
by some angle theta.

392
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,572
That, I think, we
all know how to do.

393
00:18:30,572 --> 00:18:34,700
It's some rotation matrix.

394
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,340
And then I want to
work my way out.

395
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,910
So at this point,
I know the location

396
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,340
of these four vertices.

397
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,790
In general, I know some
square and everything inside.

398
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:52,010
I want to figure out
everything in the next square.

399
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:58,190
And the creases are going to
look like this, from my zigzag

400
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,150
pattern.

401
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,435
So there's stuff in
here, which is known.

402
00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:04,050

403
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:07,165
So I already have figured out
the location of these vertices.

404
00:19:07,165 --> 00:19:09,400
And I want to know,
how do I figure out

405
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,830
these vertices on the outside?

406
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,760
If I can do that, I just repeat,
and I get a bigger and bigger

407
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,800
hyperbolic paraboloid.

408
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,340
So what I do is pretty easy.

409
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,160
I'm going to look at this
vertex first and say,

410
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,220
well, I have these
three points, and I

411
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,360
have known distances
between those three points.

412
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,140
I'm going to assume here,
and we'll see why later,

413
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,750
that each of these
creases remains

414
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,490
a straight line in
three dimensions.

415
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:43,200
It's not obvious, because
creases might bend around.

416
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,340
But let's assume
that we were going

417
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,466
to fold it in a simple way.

418
00:19:46,466 --> 00:19:48,381
These triangles are going
to remain triangles.

419
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:49,870
These edges will
remain straight.

420
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,340
And they have to
remain the same length

421
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,506
because we're paper folding.

422
00:19:52,506 --> 00:19:53,980
You can't stretch.

423
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,300
And so I know these
three points in 3D,

424
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,130
and I know these
three distances, just

425
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,620
measuring them on the crease
pattern, flat crease pattern.

426
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:07,250
So this point is on the
intersection of three spheres,

427
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,750
and the centers of the
spheres are not collinear.

428
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,920
This is a trick we used last
class but in two dimensions.

429
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,090
So I have three
non-collinear points.

430
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,950
I have three spheres--
little hard to draw--

431
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,070
centered at them.

432
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,710
The intersection of
two of the spheres

433
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:26,490
is going to be a circle,
and the intersection

434
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:32,540
with the third sphere is going
to be actually two points.

435
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,450
So the intersection of
three spheres is two points.

436
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,830
So a little bit of ambiguity.

437
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,940
But it turns out
one of these points

438
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,520
will set the mountain-valley
assignment correctly,

439
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,270
and the other one will
set it incorrectly.

440
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,580
Like if I want this to be
a mountain, one of them

441
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,760
will be inside and one
of them will be outside.

442
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,260
One of them will
make this mountain,

443
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,320
one will make it valley.

444
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,430
So it turns out if
you actually do this,

445
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,120
it's uniquely determined
at every step of the way.

446
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,120
Because you know what
mountain-valley assignment

447
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,780
you're aiming for, you uniquely
figure out what this point is.

448
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,510
By the same reasoning,
you can figure out

449
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:07,520
what this point is, intersect
these three spheres.

450
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,210
And then once I know
those two points,

451
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,876
I can figure out this
point because it's

452
00:21:10,876 --> 00:21:13,630
the intersection of
these three spheres,

453
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,570
with now these points are known.

454
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:19,865
And then I can figure out this
point in the symmetric way.

455
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:20,750
OK?

456
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,750
That's how you do it.

457
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,490
We repeat.

458
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,390
And that is exactly how
this model is built.

459
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,596

460
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:33,120
Now, this is still not a
proof that it really folds.

461
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,552
It's a construction method.

462
00:21:34,552 --> 00:21:35,635
I'd say it's an algorithm.

463
00:21:35,635 --> 00:21:38,220

464
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,660
If I start out with
the inner thing here

465
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,140
and I give you some angle,
I can approximate where

466
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,530
these vertices are.

467
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,850
And then I can keep going
and, at each step of the way,

468
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,969
approximate where
the vertices are.

469
00:21:48,969 --> 00:21:51,510
The worry is the approximation
gets worse and worse because I

470
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,480
have this propagating
error effect.

471
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,520
The larger n is,
the number of rings

472
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,330
in my hyperbolic paraboloid,
the lower the accuracy will be.

473
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,990
But I get to
choose, at each step

474
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,640
of the way, how
much precision I use

475
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,290
to compute all of these numbers.

476
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,650
Let me tell you how this
computation actually works.

477
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:13,710
I did this in Mathematica, or
we did this in Mathematica.

478
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,120
Here's Mathematica.

479
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,136
And I asked
Mathematica, well, here

480
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:20,290
is the equations for the
intersection of three spheres.

481
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:23,660
I say, well, squared Euclidean
distance between this point

482
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,224
and some unknown thing x, y,
z is this distance squared.

483
00:22:26,224 --> 00:22:28,390
And here's the second one,
and here's the third one.

484
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,680
It's kind of tiny.

485
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,840
And then here's the answer.

486
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,115

487
00:22:36,115 --> 00:22:38,150
It's a little messy.

488
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,280
In fact, you can ask how
many terms are in this thing.

489
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,250
It's 444,000 terms
in the solution.

490
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,525
Don't try this at
home, I guess, by hand.

491
00:22:49,525 --> 00:22:51,400
Intersection of three
spheres is a bit messy.

492
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,380
There's probably a cleaner way
than what Mathematica does,

493
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,100
but this is an easy
way to get it in.

494
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,650

495
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:02,140
Now, in theory-- so if you
look at all of this stuff,

496
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,710
all that's happening
is you have all

497
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,420
the various inputs, x1,
y1, x2, z2, and so on.

498
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,652
You have some numbers
like 4 and minus and 2.

499
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:14,360
All you're doing is
taking these numbers,

500
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,140
adding them, multiplying them,
dividing them, squaring them,

501
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,710
subtracting them.

502
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,790
And at some point,
taking square roots.

503
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,610
I don't know if
we'll ever see that.

504
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,235
I mean, if we search through,
there are some square roots,

505
00:23:26,235 --> 00:23:28,235
but they're going to be
in very specific places.

506
00:23:28,235 --> 00:23:31,282

507
00:23:31,282 --> 00:23:34,640
Yeah, so I probably
won't find one instantly.

508
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,490
Oh, there's one, square root.

509
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,427
So all I'm claiming
at this point

510
00:23:39,427 --> 00:23:41,260
is you can compute the
intersection of three

511
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,070
spheres just using basic
arithmetic and square roots.

512
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,245
This is called a
radical expression,

513
00:23:46,245 --> 00:23:50,170
not because it's so
amazing and controversial.

514
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:54,290
But it's radical because that
symbol is called rad, I guess,

515
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,460
and radical refers
to square roots.

516
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,660
I guess they were
crazy at the time.

517
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,940
All right.

518
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,660
Actually, I want to
stay with Mathematica.

519
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,270
So that's the idea.

520
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:09,540
Still not a proof, just
a construction method.

521
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,140
But here's a trick,
which you can

522
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,080
use to turn a construction
into an actual proof

523
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,960
that this thing exists.

524
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,740
It's called interval arithmetic,
little computer science lesson.

525
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,910

526
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:29,140
How many people have heard
of interval arithmetic?

527
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,220
No one-- one person, all right.

528
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,700
Yeah, even computer scientists
probably don't necessarily

529
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,700
know this unless they've
seen some numerical analysis.

530
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,090
So it's an idea that
instead of computing

531
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,450
an approximate location
for this point,

532
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,240
I want to get not only an
approximate location, but also

533
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,770
an error bound on how
much I don't know it.

534
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,740
So there are three
coordinates to every point.

535
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,740
For each coordinate, every
number I want to represent I'm

536
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,270
going to represent
as an interval

537
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,696
from some lower bound
to some upper bound.

538
00:25:00,696 --> 00:25:02,570
So say, well, I don't
know what the value is,

539
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:08,210
but I know that it is somewhere
in between these two numbers.

540
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,300
So represent every
number like this.

541
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,331

542
00:25:14,331 --> 00:25:16,080
And then you just need
to define, how do I

543
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,371
add numbers, subtract them,
multiply them, divide them,

544
00:25:18,371 --> 00:25:19,960
and take square roots?

545
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,410
And the answer is carefully.

546
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,480
I'll show you one example.

547
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,650
If I have two numbers,
L1, U1, and L2, U2,

548
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,950
and I want to add
them together, then I

549
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,700
believe it's pretty simple.

550
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,560
It's just L1 plus
L2, and U1 plus U2.

551
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,940
This is in perfect
mathematical world

552
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,320
where there's no round off.

553
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,040
In reality, when
you add two numbers,

554
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,567
you lose a bit of precision.

555
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:48,650
And you make sure that
when you add these numbers,

556
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,320
you always round down, and
when you add these numbers

557
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,100
you always round up.

558
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,180
So that way, these intervals,
the accumulation error

559
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,250
is realized by these
intervals getting wider.

560
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,780
You can start with
them super tiny,

561
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,280
maybe, in fact, 0
length because you

562
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,930
know exactly where these points
are, so they're 0 intervals.

563
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,650
But then, because of the
error in every operation

564
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:13,540
you do on the computer,
the intervals will widen.

565
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,540
But as long as you
do this computation

566
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:21,320
with enough bits of precision,
they'll widen slowly.

567
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,890
If you do it slowly
enough-- if you do it

568
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:26,370
with enough precision, and
the errors accumulate slowly

569
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:30,570
enough, you can build your
n-ring hyperbolic paraboloid

570
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:34,160
without any error, or
without too much error

571
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,530
to make things go wrong.

572
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:41,340
What could go wrong is that
these three spheres might not

573
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,460
intersect.

574
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,760
That's really the worry here.

575
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,820
There are two things
that could go wrong.

576
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,486
One is that the spheres
don't intersect.

577
00:26:46,486 --> 00:26:49,090
The other is that the
surface intersects itself.

578
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,980
Both would be bad.

579
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,770
How do you tell when the
spheres don't intersect?

580
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:58,204
Well, we have this formula,
this ginormous formula.

581
00:26:58,204 --> 00:26:59,620
The only thing
that could go wrong

582
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,556
is that you take a square
root of a negative number.

583
00:27:02,556 --> 00:27:04,430
Now, hopefully that
never happens in reality.

584
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,390
But what could
happen for us is we

585
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,610
have such a poor
approximation of our numbers.

586
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:12,700
And we try to take the
square root of some interval,

587
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,940
and L is less than 0.

588
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,810
Now, probably the actual
number is more than 0,

589
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,500
but we can't tell,
and we just know

590
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,208
the number is somewhere
in this interval.

591
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,560
If the lower bound
is negative, then we

592
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,760
can't take the square root.

593
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,250
We don't know what the
right answer would be.

594
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,440
So Mathematica conveniently
can do all of this for you.

595
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,860
If you just plug in
intervals instead of numbers,

596
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,110
it will do interval
arithmetic correctly,

597
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,350
and you can tell it
what precision to do.

598
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,870
And that is how we
found this example.

599
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:51,340
In fact, I will show
you the notebook,

600
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,000
and there's all this
computation and stuff.

601
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,270
This is all, I believe,
it's in our paper,

602
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,506
so if you want the code.

603
00:27:57,506 --> 00:27:58,880
So we compute the
crease patterns

604
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,950
so I can measure
all the distances.

605
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,080
And there's some collision
detection and stuff

606
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,770
to make sure
everything's working.

607
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,180
And it computes some rings.

608
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,420
And then, actually, the one I
want to show you is this one.

609
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,920
This is model we've
been looking at,

610
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,716
and here it is in
three dimensions.

611
00:28:12,716 --> 00:28:15,360

612
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,190
The way it's being rendered is
a bit odd, but you get the idea.

613
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,400
That is the hyperbolic
paraboloid we construct.

614
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,620
Now, in reality,
each of these points

615
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,000
is actually a little interval.

616
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,458
It's hard to draw
that because it's

617
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:29,280
smaller than the
resolution of the screen.

618
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,730
I think I compute
up here the-- this

619
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,170
is like how much we've
messed up the edge lengths.

620
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,670
It's like all of
these 9's, and then

621
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:40,192
this little area at the end.

622
00:28:40,192 --> 00:28:42,350
OK.

623
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,710
Cool.

624
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,470
So the point is, you just do
this with enough precision.

625
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,050
As long as you don't
end up computing

626
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:50,110
any negative square
roots, you get a surface

627
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,380
where every point is
actually a little box.

628
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,970
You don't know where the
point is exactly in that box.

629
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,866
Then you check for
collision, just knowing

630
00:28:56,866 --> 00:28:58,740
that the points are
somewhere in those boxes.

631
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,960
You try to intersect
two triangles.

632
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,800
As long as they intersect away
from the boxes, you're OK.

633
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,850
Then you know there's
no actual intersection.

634
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:10,040
And we have done that
for this triangulation up

635
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:15,040
to-- get it right--
up to n equals

636
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,900
100, 100 rings, and where
the theta angle here

637
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:27,470
is any even number between 2
and 178 degrees, so 2 degrees,

638
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,880
4 degrees, up to 178 degrees.

639
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,482
We're not interested in 180
because that would be flat.

640
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:34,440
That's not interesting.

641
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,964
We're not interested in 0.

642
00:29:35,964 --> 00:29:37,630
Every even number of
degrees in between.

643
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,740
Why even?

644
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,340
Just because of
the representation.

645
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,590
I'm sure it works for the odd.

646
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,030
In fact, I'm pretty
sure it should

647
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,290
work for any theta and any n.

648
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,560
But this technique will
only let us to prove it

649
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,001
for specific theta
and specific n.

650
00:29:51,001 --> 00:29:52,500
Because we're just
using a computer,

651
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,230
it's only going to
check one example.

652
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:57,530
We don't have a nice way
to do them all at once.

653
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,090
In case you're
interested-- oh, here I've

654
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:05,684
built it out of sheet
aluminum, I think?

655
00:30:05,684 --> 00:30:06,600
AUDIENCE: Galvanized--

656
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,980
PROFESSOR: Galvanized steel?

657
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,880
All right.

658
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,280
Water jet cut along the creases.

659
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,680
Now, steel's a little tricky
to not add extra pieces

660
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,800
by accident, so
there's a few defects.

661
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:20,660
But this is also some kind of
verification that it works.

662
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:25,250
In the computer here, the
number of digits of precision.

663
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,170
So for whatever
reason, Mathematica

664
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,950
speaks base 10
instead of base 2.

665
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:33,500
Which is weird to me, but maybe
intuitive to everyone else,

666
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,870
non-computer scientist, I guess.

667
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:37,590
So there's normal sort
of floating points

668
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,920
like 16 digits of
precision or so.

669
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,880
And there you can build this
thing up to n equals 3, 3

670
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,180
rings.

671
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,280
But you go up to about
1,000 digits of precision,

672
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,020
and then we can get beyond 100.

673
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,110
It depends, though, on what
the angle is that you fold.

674
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:55,660
So for angles that are
very big, close to 90,

675
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,720
we had to go up to 2,000
digits of precision.

676
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,650
And I don't know how
far n can go here.

677
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,260
I think maybe a couple 100,
but I'm not sure exactly.

678
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,840
The larger n is, of course,
the more accumulation you have,

679
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,460
and so you have to
do every operation

680
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,910
with more digits of precision.

681
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,530
But the conjecture would be,
any specific data and n, there's

682
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:17,090
some precision for which
this approach will work,

683
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:21,290
but we don't actually
know how to prove that.

684
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,651
All right.

685
00:31:23,651 --> 00:31:26,880
So that's a triangulated hypar.

686
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,380
Here's another
triangulation, which we also

687
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:33,630
studied in this paper, where
instead of zigzagging up

688
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,630
one quarter of the
square, we just

689
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:38,265
do all the diagonals
in the same direction.

690
00:31:38,265 --> 00:31:44,020
We still zigzag around a
ring but not between rings.

691
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,986
And this can also fold,
as the other model

692
00:31:46,986 --> 00:31:48,360
that was in the
Mathematica file.

693
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,590
I won't bother going there.

694
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:54,210
This is for a small fold angle
of just 8 degrees in here,

695
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:54,980
n equals 16.

696
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,980
And there's a reason I
did it for a small angle,

697
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,670
because it doesn't
work for large angles.

698
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,540
So that triangulation we
started with was a good one.

699
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,510
It's actually not the
first one we tried,

700
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:08,670
but it is sort of natural.

701
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,710
If you fold by a
very small amount,

702
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,590
you can get all the
way up to 133 rings,

703
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,060
but then it fails after that.

704
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:18,410
The spheres just don't
intersect anymore.

705
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:21,310
Depending on how much you fold,
like if I fold by 22 degrees,

706
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,090
I can get up to 13 rings.

707
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,010
But here I wanted
to get to 16 rings

708
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,510
so I only went up to, what was
it, 8 degrees or something.

709
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:31,860
I could have gotten a
little beyond but not a lot.

710
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,340
And up at 178, you can
still get three rings,

711
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,850
but it doesn't fold after that.

712
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:38,950

713
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:43,420
So triangulation matters,
which triangulation you do.

714
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,780
Going back to the
one that works well,

715
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,410
natural question
is, is it actually

716
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,540
a hyperbolic paraboloid?

717
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,040
It's called a hyperbolic
paraboloid because--

718
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,350
or there is a surface called
a hyperbolic paraboloid, where

719
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,780
if you take a cross-section
this way, you get a parabola.

720
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,480
That's the paraboloid part.

721
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,317
And if you take a cross-section
this way, you get a hyperbola.

722
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:05,900
That's a little
harder to draw, but it

723
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,070
goes around here
and around here.

724
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:12,830
Hyperbolas have two
connecting components.

725
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:16,065
So let's look at the
parabolic part here.

726
00:33:16,065 --> 00:33:18,190
We're supposed to be
approximating a parabola if we

727
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:21,780
look at all the points on
the top here and also maybe

728
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,510
on the bottom.

729
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,790
So that's what I've drawn.

730
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,920
The green lines, which
are very light so a little

731
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,300
tricky to see, they
zigzag back and forth,

732
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,020
and that is what we compute.

733
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,470
Again, it's approximate, but
it's so close to accurate

734
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:39,020
that I just draw them
as single points.

735
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,650
The error is much smaller than
the thickness of these lines.

736
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,050
And then the blue
and purple lines

737
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:48,020
here are fits of
the best parabola

738
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,380
that matches these points.

739
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,819
Actually, it's not
even the best parabola.

740
00:33:51,819 --> 00:33:52,610
It's kind of funny.

741
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:55,430
I just take the last three
points-- three points

742
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,710
determine a parabola.

743
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,910
I take the parabola that
fits through those three

744
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,200
points and bam!

745
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,860
It is almost a perfect fit.

746
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,800
These are the error
charts, I guess.

747
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,950
This is relative errors,
probably the most informative.

748
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:13,500
Or actually, it's the ratio--
it's not really an error--

749
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,120
the fit value over
the actual value.

750
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,580
So when it's 1, that
means it's perfect.

751
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:22,020
And yeah, this is at the end
of the chain where I fit it,

752
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,210
so of course it's going
to be perfect out here.

753
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:28,080
At the center, at
the very beginning--

754
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,130
so I'm only looking at one
quarter of this thing-- yeah,

755
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:34,710
the error is a little bit.

756
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:39,489
The ratio is not 1,
but it's 0.9997 or so,

757
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:42,219
maybe a little bit less, so
that I had to write it down.

758
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:48,760
It's like 0.003% error,
if I got it right,

759
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,226
maybe just 0.03% error.

760
00:34:52,226 --> 00:34:53,560
Fix the notes.

761
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,010
Something like that.

762
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,760
It's very small is the point.

763
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,592
But it is non-zero.

764
00:34:59,592 --> 00:35:01,050
I mean, initially
we thought, well,

765
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,580
maybe if you increase
the resolution-- you

766
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,580
make a finer and finer
hyperbolic paraboloid--

767
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:10,370
it will more closely approximate
a hyperbolic paraboloid.

768
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:13,300
That does not seem to
be true because, really,

769
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,030
making it finer is really
just like making it bigger.

770
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,326
You never really change
the center behavior.

771
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:19,200
It's always the same.

772
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,560
And this construction proves it.

773
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,660
We build the center, and we
can go as far out as we want.

774
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,439
It's just changing the
scale of the thing.

775
00:35:25,439 --> 00:35:27,230
But the center will
always remain the same,

776
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,250
and it will always
remain off the parabola,

777
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,750
but super, super close.

778
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:34,460
Really, it's all right to call
this a hyperbolic paraboloid,

779
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:39,020
but you should
triangulate, especially

780
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,960
if you're making something
out of more rigid material.

781
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,010
Cool.

782
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,130
Let's go on.

783
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:48,835

784
00:35:48,835 --> 00:35:49,751
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

785
00:35:49,751 --> 00:35:50,951
PROFESSOR: Yeah, question.

786
00:35:50,951 --> 00:35:52,875
AUDIENCE: Do the creases
have to be uniform?

787
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:56,730
I mean, could you
tighten up inside?

788
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,910
PROFESSOR: The creases do
not have to be uniform.

789
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,900
Most of the hyperbolic
paraboloids we've made,

790
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,020
we do evenly space
all the squares,

791
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,820
but they don't have to be.

792
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,990
I say that in that we've
made them out of paper,

793
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,660
and they fold to
something, and you

794
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,690
get other kinds of surfaces.

795
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:16,050
Probably not going to be a
hyperbolic paraboloid anymore.

796
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,990
I have not done it
with Mathematica

797
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:21,655
and checked that it really is
possible, but it should be.

798
00:36:21,655 --> 00:36:23,780
That would be a fun thing
to explore at some point.

799
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,500

800
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,460
Other questions?

801
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:28,960
All right.

802
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,590
So this is the end
of the positive news

803
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,860
for hyperbolic paraboloids.

804
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,220
Now we're going to go
to the negative stuff,

805
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,800
showing that it is
impossible to fold

806
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,090
this with this crease pattern.

807
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:45,040
Hyperbolic paraboloids don't
exist without triangulation.

808
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,820
For this we need a
little bit of math tools

809
00:36:50,820 --> 00:37:04,520
in this paper, "How Paper
Folds Between Creases."

810
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,620
So in the study
that we just did,

811
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,500
I assumed that all of the
creases stayed straight.

812
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,930
And therefore that all
of the faces-- therefore?

813
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,970
Yeah, I guess, because
triangles are rigid.

814
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,405
If I forced the edges of the
triangle to stay straight,

815
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,780
then the interior
of the triangle

816
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,490
must stay flat just
to preserve distances.

817
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:29,060
So I assumed that every face of
the piece of paper stayed flat.

818
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,480
Why did I assume that?

819
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,610
Because paper, real
paper, does not

820
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:37,446
have to stay flat in
between the creases.

821
00:37:37,446 --> 00:37:40,010
This is real stuff here.

822
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:45,230
But paper is constrained on how
it can curve without creases,

823
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:49,280
and that is the purpose of this
little mathematical endeavour.

824
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,630

825
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:56,290
There's some technical stuff,
and I want to get to the meat

826
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,000
as quickly as possible.

827
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,450
But I'll just mention
some assumptions.

828
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,730
We assume that the
thing that we fold,

829
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:06,640
the folding of our piece
of paper, is piecewise C2.

830
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,250
C2 means you can
take two derivatives,

831
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:12,790
and it's still good and
continuous and sort of smooth

832
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,290
up to the second level.

833
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:17,080
Piecewise means, of
course, we have creases.

834
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,750
Those are not C2, not even C1.

835
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,320
So we have some crease
pattern on our piece of paper.

836
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,620
It's whatever.

837
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:27,520
And what we mean is that inside
one of these regions, it's C2.

838
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,360
On the creases, it's nothing.

839
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:29,950
It's C0.

840
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:30,960
It's continuous.

841
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,290
We don't rip the paper.

842
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,830
But we don't necessarily
have derivatives everywhere.

843
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,340
So that's the assumption.

844
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,670
Now, one annoying
thing here is you

845
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:43,960
can have something called
a semi-crease, something

846
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:49,270
we call a semi-crease,
which is C1 but not C2.

847
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,470
Yeah.

848
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:53,230
So you have to
divide into pieces,

849
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,356
but it's not
technically a crease.

850
00:38:55,356 --> 00:38:57,730
And this is some of the worry
of what might be happening.

851
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:59,470
Maybe you don't
need creases here,

852
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,720
you only need semi-creases.

853
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,095
Maybe you only need to violate
the second derivative, not

854
00:39:03,095 --> 00:39:04,390
the first.

855
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,440
Creases should be violation
of first derivative.

856
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,010
Those are sharp things.

857
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:12,190
Semi-creases are just
kind of little sharp.

858
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,810
It's like-- what's a good
example of a semi-sharp thing?

859
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:18,230
I guess if I take a
parabola, and then

860
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:22,694
I take a more shallow
parabola, then at this point

861
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:25,110
there's no second derivative
because the first derivatives

862
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:25,610
don't meet.

863
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,420
This one has a first
derivative of this.

864
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,500
This one has a first
derivative of that.

865
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,410
They're not the same.

866
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,770
Is that true?

867
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,170
Parabolas maybe not.

868
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,280
But you get the idea.

869
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,000
This is a discontinuity
in the second derivative,

870
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,510
not the first.

871
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,010
All right.

872
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,800
I'm going to basically
ignore semi-creases here,

873
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,620
though, because they're
just kind of a technicality.

874
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,786
They don't end up mattering.

875
00:39:46,786 --> 00:39:49,670

876
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,550
So we have piecewise C2.

877
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:56,320
And we assume that our
surface is intrinsically flat,

878
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,666
meaning it came from a
piece of paper-- trinsic--

879
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:07,330
oh, boy, intrinsically flat.

880
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:11,190
Now this is something we
know as curvature zero.

881
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:15,456

882
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:17,830
And I want to tell you a little
bit more about curvature.

883
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:20,150
We have defined curvature
in a few different-- well,

884
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,180
I guess in one
particular way, which

885
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:26,530
is you add up the material,
and you take 360 minus that.

886
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,290
So curvature zero
means you have 360

887
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,265
of material, which is good news.

888
00:40:30,265 --> 00:40:33,567

889
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:35,150
But there are other
ways to define it,

890
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:37,330
in particular, the
way Gauss defined it.

891
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,865
This is usually called
Gaussian curvature

892
00:40:39,865 --> 00:40:41,380
because he invented it.

893
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:45,770
Gauss defined curvature
of a 3D surface.

894
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:49,430
You have some weird
curved 3D thing,

895
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:53,220
like this shape,
the orange part.

896
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,080
And there's actually a lot of
natural notions of curvature

897
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,660
here.

898
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,719
Gaussian curvature
is just one of them.

899
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:00,510
So let me tell you a
little bit about that.

900
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,170
We're looking at
this point, and I

901
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:05,380
want to compute the
curvature of this point.

902
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,500
Well, if I look
in any direction,

903
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,790
like say this red
direction-- so it's

904
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:15,160
like I slice this world with
a plane, this blue plane,

905
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,230
I get a nice
one-dimensional curve.

906
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:22,750
Then the curvature is how bent
that curve is at that point.

907
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,320
That's like a
directional curvature.

908
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,380
In this direction, how bent
is-- what does how bent mean?

909
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,030
It just means you try to
nestle a circle in there,

910
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,790
in that plane, and you
take 1 over the radius.

911
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:34,781
That's a curvature.

912
00:41:34,781 --> 00:41:35,280
OK?

913
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,850
So if it's flat, the radius
could be infinite, and so

914
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,180
curvature zero.

915
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:42,130
If it's very sharp, then
the radius is very small.

916
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:45,260
And so 1 over the radius is
very large, big curvature.

917
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,850
So it's some thing here.

918
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,380
Let's say it's a
positive number.

919
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,760
And then if I take, for example,
this other blue plane, so

920
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,990
this cross-section,
in that direction

921
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,750
the curvature is
bent the other way.

922
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,055
So you say, well, there
the directional curvature

923
00:41:59,055 --> 00:42:00,695
is negative.

924
00:42:00,695 --> 00:42:01,820
It depends which way is up.

925
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,220
One of them is positive,
one of them is negative.

926
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,920
Somewhere in between
it's going to be 0.

927
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,750
But you have all these different
directional curvatures.

928
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:14,000
The Gaussian curvature,
which is the one

929
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,430
that we sort of know and love
and have used a lot, mostly

930
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:23,890
for polyhedra, is the
min directional curvature

931
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:27,830
times the max
directional curvature.

932
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:29,610
Now, I really mean min and max.

933
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:31,750
So the smallest one, in
this case, is negative.

934
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,100
The largest one is positive.

935
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,990
You take the product, and
that's the Gaussian curvature.

936
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:39,064
It's a weird thing.

937
00:42:39,064 --> 00:42:40,480
But in particular,
because there's

938
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,105
a negative one and
a positive one here,

939
00:42:42,105 --> 00:42:44,700
that means the
product is negative,

940
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,769
and that's because
this is a saddle.

941
00:42:46,769 --> 00:42:48,560
Still the case, negative
Gaussian curvature

942
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,420
means saddle.

943
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,090
Positive means a convex cone.

944
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:54,380
0 means intrinsically flat.

945
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,855
So this is still
the thing we know,

946
00:42:56,855 --> 00:42:58,730
but this is a weird way
of thinking about it.

947
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,290
This is how Gauss defined it.

948
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:02,740
And he proved that even
if you fold the surface,

949
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,660
the Gaussian curvature
never changes.

950
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:10,060
That is called the
theorema egregium.

951
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,040
Cool name.

952
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,700
So Gaussian curvature
doesn't change under folding.

953
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,500
We start with something
that's flat, zero curvature.

954
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,276
Because if you
take a flat plane,

955
00:43:20,276 --> 00:43:22,400
you take any directional
curvature, everything's 0.

956
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,060
So it's the product
of min and mix.

957
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,340
They're both 0.

958
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:29,470
So we start with something zero
curvature, it will remain so.

959
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:31,440
Now, if I have a
product of two things,

960
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,760
and I know this is
equal to 0, that

961
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,455
means one of the two
things is 0, maybe both.

962
00:43:36,455 --> 00:43:40,110
If it's still a plane,
both of them will be 0.

963
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,700
But one of them
still has to be 0.

964
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,990
What this means is, basically,
locally at any point,

965
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:49,480
we have a cylinder, some
kind of generalized cylinder.

966
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,689
But it really only
curves in one direction

967
00:43:52,689 --> 00:43:55,230
because there's some direction
where it doesn't curve at all.

968
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:57,549
Everything's straight.

969
00:43:57,549 --> 00:43:59,090
In all the other
directions, yeah, it

970
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:00,490
curves different amounts.

971
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:03,540
The orthogonal direction will
be where it curves the most.

972
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:08,840
That will be the max, I
guess, and the min will be 0.

973
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,990
So that is what a
folded sheet looks like.

974
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,730
And it's maybe not
so obvious, but when

975
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:15,730
I did all this
contorting and what not,

976
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:20,615
really I was only bending in
one dimension, like a cylinder.

977
00:44:20,615 --> 00:44:22,240
That's not exactly
a cylinder because I

978
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:27,380
can change the radius of the
cylinder all over the place,

979
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:30,240
but I'm really only
bending in one direction.

980
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,050
I was reading on Wikipedia,
this explains how we eat pizza.

981
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:36,340
Because you take
a piece of pizza,

982
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,210
which is basically
like a piece of paper,

983
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:41,530
and if you bend it a little
bit, like you push in the center

984
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:43,882
and push up on the
sides, you give it

985
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:45,215
some curvature in one direction.

986
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,423
And therefore it has to
remain straight in the other,

987
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:52,719
so it kind of supports
the piece of pizza.

988
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:54,510
Never thought of it
that way, but there you

989
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:57,420
go, practical applications
for this stuff.

990
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,570
All right.

991
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:02,780
These things we
call planar points.

992
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:06,940
If I have a point p and it's
locally flat like a plane,

993
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,340
call it planar.

994
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,785
These things, for some crazy
reason, we call parabolic.

995
00:45:11,785 --> 00:45:15,690

996
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:17,600
This is to be consistent
with other notation.

997
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,490
I know it looks-- cylindrical
would be another fine term.

998
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:22,510
But there's a third
kind called a elliptic,

999
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:23,960
which would be like this stuff.

1000
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,890
That doesn't happen.

1001
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,820
So we just worry about
locally cylinder, which

1002
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:29,320
we're going to call parabolic
because it's also like locally

1003
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:34,690
a parabola, doesn't
matter, and locally planar.

1004
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,170
Those are the two kinds
of points we can have.

1005
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:43,520
Now, I'm going to give you some
accelerated facts we're just

1006
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,730
going to take as given
from differential geometry.

1007
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:50,650
Well, really, we had
to take some facts that

1008
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:52,930
were about differential
geometry and sort of port

1009
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:55,100
them to our context.

1010
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,090
They didn't give us
exactly what we wanted.

1011
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:00,010
We had to generalize
them a little.

1012
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:02,700
Differential geometry, if you
were at Sunday's lectures,

1013
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:07,590
that was one of the main
tools being used there.

1014
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:11,650
Differential geometry is about
smooth things, like C4 usually.

1015
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:13,460
Now, sometimes about C2 things.

1016
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,770
It is almost never about
piecewise C2 things.

1017
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:18,834
So you got to worry
about the pieces.

1018
00:46:18,834 --> 00:46:20,250
Now, most the time,
we're thinking

1019
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:23,800
about one little region
here, and that's nice in C2.

1020
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,980
And you can check.

1021
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,440
Most of the differential
geometry still applies there.

1022
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,486
Blah, blah, blah.

1023
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:30,610
Let me tell you some facts.

1024
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:33,220

1025
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:38,670
If I take a smooth point, so
that means not on a crease

1026
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:46,610
and not a semi-crease,
then it lies on something

1027
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:52,290
called a rule segment,
which is a line segment,

1028
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:55,680
also called a rule line.

1029
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,240
And the endpoints
of that segment,

1030
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:07,150
here's the interesting part,
are on creases or the boundary.

1031
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:14,130

1032
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:16,930
So we already know
from this picture

1033
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:19,970
that any point
lies on a segment,

1034
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:22,940
like an actual 3D
line segment, because

1035
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,970
of this parabolic nature.

1036
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:27,740
What's interesting is that
segment, it can't stop.

1037
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:31,510
Just keeps on going,
like the Energizer bunny,

1038
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:32,870
until it hits a crease.

1039
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:34,480
At that point,
things aren't smooth.

1040
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,840
We don't know what happens.

1041
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,140
But really, these
creases go straight.

1042
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:40,320
Those are rule lines.

1043
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,270
And here, actually, we have
a choice, many different rule

1044
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:43,970
lines.

1045
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:48,160
But in the parabolic case,
that rule line is unique.

1046
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:54,235
It's going to be unique
for parabolic points.

1047
00:47:54,235 --> 00:48:00,140

1048
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:08,480
And so we get what's called a
ruled surface, which is just

1049
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:14,400
the union of a whole bunch
of line segments, rule lines,

1050
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,480
around any point.

1051
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:23,250

1052
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:30,090
Maybe any smooth
point, just to be safe.

1053
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:32,045
So you may have heard
of ruled surfaces.

1054
00:48:32,045 --> 00:48:32,920
They're quite common.

1055
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,960
They're fun because you can
build them out of strings.

1056
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,950
So each string, if you hold
taut, it's a line segment.

1057
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:41,450
Take a whole bunch of them
and just imagine the envelope

1058
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:41,949
there.

1059
00:48:41,949 --> 00:48:43,991
That is a 3D surface, and
that's a ruled surface.

1060
00:48:43,991 --> 00:48:45,740
Now this one does not
have zero curvature.

1061
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:47,350
It has negative
curvature everywhere.

1062
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:48,520
So that can't happen.

1063
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,360
This actually can happen.

1064
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,740
This is like you take
a helix, and so there's

1065
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:57,050
a blue curve in
3D, a space curve.

1066
00:48:57,050 --> 00:49:01,119
And then you imagine taking
the tangent at every point.

1067
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,660
So just like if you just went
straight at every point instead

1068
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,550
of turning, then you
get a bunch of lines.

1069
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:07,930
Those are rule lines.

1070
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:10,450
And you get this cool surface.

1071
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:12,920
Now, that is a valid
folding of a piece of paper.

1072
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,880
Doesn't look like a
cylinder, does it?

1073
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,650
But locally, each of these
lines looks like a cylinder.

1074
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,675
It's just the radius
of the cylinder

1075
00:49:19,675 --> 00:49:23,688
is changing all over the place.

1076
00:49:23,688 --> 00:49:27,570
But that's a valid folding
of a piece of paper, I think.

1077
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:30,866
Has zero curvature
everywhere, if I did it right.

1078
00:49:30,866 --> 00:49:36,130
Or I didn't do it, but if
I imagine it correctly.

1079
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:36,630
All right.

1080
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:38,310
So it's a ruled surface, great.

1081
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:42,180
I mean, I can really create
my whole surface locally

1082
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:45,729
around a point by a whole
bunch of rule segments.

1083
00:49:45,729 --> 00:49:48,020
They're not all going to be
parallel or anything, which

1084
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,910
is what we imagined
from the cylinder.

1085
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:51,440
They can turn around.

1086
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,290
But these segments do keep going
until they hit another crease.

1087
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:55,980
Maybe the blue line's a crease.

1088
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:59,260
And the boundary here could
be the boundary of the paper,

1089
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,755
could be a crease boundary.

1090
00:50:00,755 --> 00:50:02,580
But that's what they look like.

1091
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:08,610
Now, it's also what we
call torsal, torsal ruled.

1092
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:12,690
Here we get to somewhat
more obscure terminology

1093
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:14,070
but some useful things.

1094
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:14,995
It's quite restricted.

1095
00:50:14,995 --> 00:50:18,470

1096
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:27,461
I want to have a common
tangent plane throughout a rule

1097
00:50:27,461 --> 00:50:27,960
segment.

1098
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,530

1099
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:36,120
So if I look at any one
of these rule segments,

1100
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,000
there's one plane,
which is going

1101
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,040
to be like this, that is tangent
to the surface at every point

1102
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,129
along that segment.

1103
00:50:44,129 --> 00:50:46,170
So in general, you might
imagine that the tangent

1104
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:48,870
plane turns as we go along.

1105
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:51,590
But these segments are kind of--
they're locally cylindrical.

1106
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,530
So you can really make a
tangent plane all the way along.

1107
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:59,140
Whereas here, that's
probably not true.

1108
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:01,719
Imagine the tangent plane
starts-- can you see my hand?

1109
00:51:01,719 --> 00:51:03,260
It starts to bend
like this, and it's

1110
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,380
going to bend around like that.

1111
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,752
It twists along a single line.

1112
00:51:07,752 --> 00:51:09,460
In our case where we
have zero curvature,

1113
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,520
it's actually going
to be torsal ruled,

1114
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,125
meaning the tangent plane
just goes straight along each

1115
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:14,750
of these lines.

1116
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:17,620
We're going to need this,
that's why I mention it.

1117
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:21,430
Another fun fact
along the same spirit

1118
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:27,630
is that the points
along a rule line

1119
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:29,910
are all the same in
terms of whether they

1120
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:32,770
are planar or parabolic.

1121
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:36,250
So I'll call them uniformly
planar slash parabolic.

1122
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:39,690

1123
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:42,010
Remember, planar just
means it lies in a plane.

1124
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:43,780
Parabolic is the other case.

1125
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,856
So here everything's parabolic.

1126
00:51:45,856 --> 00:51:47,855
But you can't like suddenly
switch in the middle

1127
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:48,920
and become flat.

1128
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,734
That's not allowed,
not possible.

1129
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:53,900
So those are some fun facts.

1130
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,150
We're not going to prove them.

1131
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:58,107
If you want to see the proofs,
they're a bit technical.

1132
00:51:58,107 --> 00:52:00,690
You have to read our paper, and
then the differential geometry

1133
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:02,000
books we cite.

1134
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,982
But a bunch of these things, you
can understand the proofs just

1135
00:52:05,982 --> 00:52:07,940
assuming a little bit of
differential geometry,

1136
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:08,770
and it's not too hard.

1137
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:10,894
It's in our paper, but it's
a little bit technical.

1138
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:14,680
So I want to look at the
things that are more related

1139
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:18,230
to paper folding,
how paper folds.

1140
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:19,980
This is obviously
related, but it's

1141
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:24,130
like the foundation on which
we build what I care about.

1142
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:26,710
What I care about
most-- all right,

1143
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:30,080
let me tell you a fun fact,
what we're going to prove.

1144
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:34,520
We want this nice proper folding
of the hyperbolic paraboloid,

1145
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,640
meaning every crease is bent
by a non-zero angle and not 180

1146
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,490
degrees.

1147
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:42,210
In that situation,
first claim is

1148
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:44,920
every crease remains straight.

1149
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:50,090
Second claim is every
face remains rigid,

1150
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:54,760
can't bend anywhere--
every interior face.

1151
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,720
These guys on the boundary,
they can do crazy things.

1152
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,430
And you see that
in the model, where

1153
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:01,960
the outside gets
kind of all wiggly.

1154
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,367
That's allowed.

1155
00:53:03,367 --> 00:53:04,950
The outside faces,
the ones that share

1156
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:08,150
the boundary with the paper,
can wiggle, can curve.

1157
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:10,630
But everything else
has to remain flat

1158
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:13,020
if there are no
creases in there.

1159
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,760
And that's not at all obvious.

1160
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,925
So we're going to prove it.

1161
00:53:18,925 --> 00:53:20,889
And I need some water.

1162
00:53:20,889 --> 00:53:28,237

1163
00:53:28,237 --> 00:53:28,736
All right.

1164
00:53:28,736 --> 00:53:31,960

1165
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:39,140
First claim, I'll call it
polygonal implies flat.

1166
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:43,210
So what I mean is, suppose
I have some region of paper.

1167
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:45,160
It's in the middle somewhere.

1168
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,180
Let's say it's smooth.

1169
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:51,317
And I look at the
boundary of the region.

1170
00:53:51,317 --> 00:53:52,775
Doesn't actually
have to be smooth.

1171
00:53:52,775 --> 00:53:54,040
It could have semi-creases.

1172
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,290
But it has no creases inside.

1173
00:53:56,290 --> 00:54:00,890
Suppose the boundary
in 3D is a polygon,

1174
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:04,464
so it's piecewise straight.

1175
00:54:04,464 --> 00:54:06,380
I don't know how that
corresponds to anything,

1176
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,620
but say the boundary
is straight.

1177
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:12,490
Then the inside must be planar.

1178
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:17,260
So if I have a
polygonal boundary,

1179
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:21,560
then I have a flat
planar inside.

1180
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:25,330

1181
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:26,710
This is assuming no creases.

1182
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:30,871

1183
00:54:30,871 --> 00:54:31,370
OK?

1184
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:35,600
So what that means is that
every point inside this region

1185
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,780
must be planar, not parabolic.

1186
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,530
That's what we want to prove.

1187
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:41,610
So let's do a proof
by contradiction,

1188
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:43,790
and suppose that we
have a parabolic point.

1189
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:46,410

1190
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:52,210
So we have some point,
and locally it is curved,

1191
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:54,110
and we know there's a
rule line through it.

1192
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:57,140
I know by smoothness,
by continuity,

1193
00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:05,330
that if this guy is parabolic,
it's bent, then, in fact,

1194
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:08,150
all the points nearby
should also be bent,

1195
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:12,442
because you can't go instantly
from bent to straight.

1196
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:13,650
You've got to do that slowly.

1197
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:15,066
So there's some
little region-- we

1198
00:55:15,066 --> 00:55:19,690
call this a neighborhood--
around the point that

1199
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:20,465
is all parabolic.

1200
00:55:20,465 --> 00:55:23,252

1201
00:55:23,252 --> 00:55:24,960
So I'll call this
parabolic neighborhood.

1202
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,161

1203
00:55:28,161 --> 00:55:28,660
All right.

1204
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,770
All of those points
have unique rule lines.

1205
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:33,600
That's what we've been saying.

1206
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,930
So I take this
little neighborhood,

1207
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:38,160
and each one of them
defines some rule line.

1208
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,890

1209
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:42,610
Those rule lines
go all the way out

1210
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:47,360
to the boundary
something like this.

1211
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,050
Now, this boundary
is the boundary.

1212
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:53,320
That means it's polygonal,
can't be curved like this.

1213
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,320
In fact, it looks
something like this.

1214
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,630
Maybe this is straight.

1215
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:58,970
Maybe this has two segments.

1216
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:00,550
We don't know how many segments.

1217
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:03,180
I just want to look at
one of these segments here

1218
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:05,150
and all the rule lines
coming out of it.

1219
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:08,192
So what I have is I have
the boundary of the paper.

1220
00:56:08,192 --> 00:56:10,830
That's a poor imitation
of a straight line.

1221
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:12,530
Straight line.

1222
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:14,220
I have some rule
lines coming out.

1223
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,912
Now, I don't really know
what they look like.

1224
00:56:16,912 --> 00:56:18,620
I want to understand
what they look like.

1225
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:19,980
This is in 3D.

1226
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,372
Imagine.

1227
00:56:21,372 --> 00:56:24,400
OK, this is straight.

1228
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,440
First thing I want to look at
is the normal to the surface.

1229
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:33,190
So normal is like
perpendicular to the surface.

1230
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:36,440
It's easy to define normals in
the interior of the surface,

1231
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,680
but I can actually extend
that out to the boundary.

1232
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,470
So I want to look
at a normal here.

1233
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:44,220

1234
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:48,540
Maybe let me put it here,
something like that.

1235
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,770
If I took normals really
close to the boundary,

1236
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:52,650
I just took the limit
out to the boundary,

1237
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:53,816
I'll get some normal vector.

1238
00:56:53,816 --> 00:56:55,765
And by smoothness, that exists.

1239
00:56:55,765 --> 00:56:59,560
Just wave my hands
there, but that's true.

1240
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,310
OK, what's true
about this normal?

1241
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:04,050
Well, it's perpendicular
to the surface.

1242
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:05,810
Now locally, the
surface here, it's

1243
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:10,420
defined by the plane of this
line segment and this line

1244
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:11,610
segment.

1245
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:14,630
So in fact, it's
perpendicular to the boundary,

1246
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:20,220
and it's perpendicular
here to the rule line.

1247
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,970
Buy that?

1248
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:25,065
If I take some other normal,
like this one-- sorry,

1249
00:57:25,065 --> 00:57:28,560
like that, it's also
perpendicular to this,

1250
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,560
but it's perpendicular to
some other rule line now.

1251
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:35,050
So these guys are
perpendicular to a common line,

1252
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:39,180
but they may not be
the same direction.

1253
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:43,410
What we do know, though,
is that it's torsal.

1254
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:45,730
There is a single
tangent plane that's

1255
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:48,210
perpendicular to this
entire rule line, which

1256
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:50,030
means the normal is
the thing perpendicular

1257
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:51,200
to that tangent plane.

1258
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,340
So in fact, all of the
normals along this line

1259
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:56,400
are identical, which
is kind of neat.

1260
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,380
These guys are all parallel.

1261
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,405
Same thing here.

1262
00:58:00,405 --> 00:58:01,155
I won't draw that.

1263
00:58:01,155 --> 00:58:03,400
It's going to get too messy.

1264
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,641
So what?

1265
00:58:04,641 --> 00:58:05,140
All right.

1266
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:09,130
Well, here's a crazy
thing to imagine.

1267
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:11,810
I will look at the
derivative of the normal.

1268
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:13,951
So I have this point p.

1269
00:58:13,951 --> 00:58:16,450
Imagine you have a point p, and
it's moving along this curve

1270
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:17,710
continuously.

1271
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:18,560
Sorry-- not curve.

1272
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:19,850
This is a straight line.

1273
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:24,450
It's moving along this edge
of the boundary just once.

1274
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:26,310
It goes like this.

1275
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:30,100
And I'm going to define n of
p is the normal at that point.

1276
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:33,775
So it starts at something,
and then maybe it's changing.

1277
00:58:33,775 --> 00:58:35,775
I get to this normal,
then I get to this normal,

1278
00:58:35,775 --> 00:58:38,320
and then who knows
what it looks like.

1279
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,847
I want to understand,
can it change at all?

1280
00:58:40,847 --> 00:58:42,430
So to understand its
change, I'm going

1281
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:45,390
to take the derivative,
n prime of p.

1282
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:47,370
So this is as p
moves along here,

1283
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:49,890
how does the normal change?

1284
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:53,000
I claim, in fact, it
can't change at all.

1285
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,280
Why?

1286
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:59,210
Well, the derivative of
the normal, first of all,

1287
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:03,170
must be perpendicular to-- I
haven't given anything a name

1288
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:04,530
here.

1289
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:07,620
This thing is the boundary edge.

1290
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:13,850

1291
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,340
So here's my boundary edge.

1292
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:18,200
Every single normal here--
I didn't draw the greatest

1293
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,980
picture-- of those have to
be perpendicular to this one

1294
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:21,610
common edge.

1295
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:24,160
Here's the fact where we use
that this is a straight line.

1296
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,270
If it curves, then this
is not a consistent thing.

1297
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:31,090
But because it's straight for
a while, all of these guys

1298
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:33,370
are perpendicular
to the same thing.

1299
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:36,030
All of the ends are
perpendicular to the boundary

1300
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:36,569
edge.

1301
00:59:36,569 --> 00:59:38,360
This is just little
perpendicular notation.

1302
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:42,730

1303
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:45,110
And if all of the n's are
perpendicular to the boundary

1304
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:47,489
edge, the change in n must
also be perpendicular.

1305
00:59:47,489 --> 00:59:49,280
Otherwise, it would
change in such in a way

1306
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,600
it's longer perpendicular.

1307
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,100
OK?

1308
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,175
So that's just
sort of intuitive.

1309
00:59:53,175 --> 00:59:56,490

1310
00:59:56,490 --> 00:59:58,300
Great.

1311
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,010
What else?

1312
00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:01,290
I need it to be perpendicular
to something else.

1313
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:05,970

1314
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:09,230
I claim that n
prime of p is also

1315
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:13,450
perpendicular to the rule line.

1316
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:14,280
Ah, yes.

1317
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:20,589
Because this normal-- all of
these points along a rule line

1318
01:00:20,589 --> 01:00:21,880
have the same normal direction.

1319
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,330
These guys were all parallel.

1320
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:28,335
And so if I look
at the change in n,

1321
01:00:28,335 --> 01:00:31,850
in order to make all
these guys be the same,

1322
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:38,680
I also cannot change n in such a
way that it has a non-trivial--

1323
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,442
I'm not going to
say this too well.

1324
01:00:40,442 --> 01:00:44,120
Do you believe it, more or less?

1325
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,300
Let me try to say it once.

1326
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:48,884

1327
01:00:48,884 --> 01:00:50,550
I'm looking at the
change in the normal.

1328
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:52,560
I don't want the normal
to change in such a way

1329
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,350
that it will change
along this axis.

1330
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:57,890
So for that to be true,
the change in the normal

1331
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:59,655
must be perpendicular
to this direction.

1332
01:00:59,655 --> 01:01:03,340

1333
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:06,200
This is kind of weird
because the normal is also

1334
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,770
perpendicular to this direction.

1335
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:09,820
I mean, the normal
satisfies the same things.

1336
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:11,486
It's perpendicular
to the boundary edge.

1337
01:01:11,486 --> 01:01:13,690
It's also perpendicular
to the rule line.

1338
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:20,132
That means that n, the
normal, and its derivative,

1339
01:01:20,132 --> 01:01:21,340
they have the same direction.

1340
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:26,410

1341
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:28,310
That's weird.

1342
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:33,960
In fact, it means that
the derivative must be 0.

1343
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,670
Because the normal is
always unit length.

1344
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:38,170
So this would be saying that
the normal is getting bigger

1345
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:40,310
or shorter, but it
can't do either.

1346
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:42,551
So in fact, normal's
not changing at all.

1347
01:01:42,551 --> 01:01:44,300
So in fact, all of
these guys are parallel

1348
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,440
along the whole segment.

1349
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:49,990
That means this
whole region is flat,

1350
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:52,520
and that's a contradiction.

1351
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,020
All right?

1352
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:56,700
So I waved my hands a little
bit, especially on this step,

1353
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,120
but believe me.

1354
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:01,150

1355
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:01,970
All right.

1356
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:04,860
That's one fun fact,
but we want more.

1357
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:07,580

1358
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:10,080
Because how do we know that the
boundary would be polygonal?

1359
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,710

1360
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:18,976
For that we need that straight
creases remain straight.

1361
01:02:18,976 --> 01:02:21,575
And something's not true
when you have curve creases.

1362
01:02:21,575 --> 01:02:24,907

1363
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,740
Curve creases obviously
don't remain curved.

1364
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:28,531
But curve creases don't
even remain planar.

1365
01:02:28,531 --> 01:02:31,180
I mean, they can
do crazy things.

1366
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:38,350
But straight creases
stay straight.

1367
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:45,480

1368
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,850
So what I mean is, I have
my flat piece of paper.

1369
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:50,505
I take a straight line
in the piece of paper,

1370
01:02:50,505 --> 01:02:52,470
and I say that's
going to be a crease.

1371
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:54,475
It has no first derivative
along the crease.

1372
01:02:54,475 --> 01:02:57,960

1373
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:01,940
Then when I fold that,
I get a straight line

1374
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:06,960
and some crazy stuff
on the other side,

1375
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,390
but that crease
remains straight.

1376
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:09,505
So I was in the
middle of the paper,

1377
01:03:09,505 --> 01:03:10,920
so it actually looks like this.

1378
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:15,740

1379
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:18,360
Remains a straight segment,
obviously of the same length.

1380
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:24,262
But the point is it can't
curl, and it can't even kink.

1381
01:03:24,262 --> 01:03:28,180
Now, just any good theorem
needs a counter-example.

1382
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:33,530
So if we take a piece of paper
and we make a straight crease,

1383
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:37,310
look, I can curl that crease.

1384
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:39,730
So this theorem is
not true unless I

1385
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:42,800
say that the crease is proper.

1386
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,550
So here I had to make the crease
all the way to 180 degrees,

1387
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:47,550
then I can curl it.

1388
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:50,850
Also, if I don't fold it
at all, then I can curl it.

1389
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:54,200
But if it's folded something
in the middle, I cannot curl.

1390
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,670
Paper will not be happy with me.

1391
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:59,260
I need extra creases
in order to curl.

1392
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:00,825
Well, yeah, it's
just not possible.

1393
01:04:00,825 --> 01:04:03,910

1394
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:16,590
So proper crease, which
means the fold angle

1395
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:25,040
is not equal to 0 or
plus or minus 180.

1396
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,220
So that's the theorem.

1397
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:26,980
Let's prove it.

1398
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:40,549

1399
01:04:40,549 --> 01:04:41,590
Maybe go a little faster.

1400
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:46,550

1401
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:48,294
All right.

1402
01:04:48,294 --> 01:04:50,210
So we have our crease,
and in three dimensions

1403
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:51,530
it might look curved.

1404
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:54,890
We take some point.

1405
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:56,880
We know that the paper is flat.

1406
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,010
So if you look at the left
side and the right side

1407
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:05,020
of the piece of paper,
locally, at least, it's flat.

1408
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:07,400
And I want to think
of there being

1409
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,970
some tangent plane
on the right side

1410
01:05:09,970 --> 01:05:12,870
and some tangent plane
on the left side.

1411
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:14,440
Wow, that's not a good picture.

1412
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,860
Let me draw the planes first.

1413
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:20,730
So here's two planes, and
then here's my point p.

1414
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:24,290
And locally the surface actually
lies in these two planes

1415
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:26,230
and kinks here.

1416
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:27,990
The surface kinks.

1417
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:29,800
We want the crease
to be straight here,

1418
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:35,030
but maybe the crease is
bent something like that.

1419
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:36,010
All right.

1420
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:39,020
Here's what we do.

1421
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:41,680
Again, I want to think
of-- in this case,

1422
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,910
I'm going to look at
tangents, not normals.

1423
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:46,410
So I'm going to say, well,
every point on the curve

1424
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:47,870
here has some tangent.

1425
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:50,790
In fact, the tangent
at this point

1426
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:52,337
must lie right along
the intersection

1427
01:05:52,337 --> 01:05:53,170
of these two planes.

1428
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:55,360
I'm going to give
these planes names.

1429
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,100
This is p.

1430
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:58,140
This is going to be
tangent plane Tp,

1431
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:00,100
and this is going to be
other tangent plane Sp,

1432
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,670
so on the left and
the right side.

1433
01:06:02,670 --> 01:06:07,346
So the normal at p-- sorry, not
the normal, the tangent at p--

1434
01:06:07,346 --> 01:06:11,012
did I give it a name-- p prime.

1435
01:06:11,012 --> 01:06:12,470
That's what you'd
normally call it.

1436
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:14,450
That's the derivative.

1437
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:20,280
Tangent of p lies
along the intersection

1438
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,180
of those two planes.

1439
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:24,231
We don't really need
that, but it's true.

1440
01:06:24,231 --> 01:06:25,230
Give you some intuition.

1441
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:26,620
Now, what I'm
really going to use

1442
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:29,670
is the second derivative,
little more extreme here.

1443
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:33,275
Second derivative is
curvature on the curve.

1444
01:06:33,275 --> 01:06:36,170

1445
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:43,680
Now, we know that in
the unfolded surface,

1446
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,320
there's exactly 180
degrees of material here.

1447
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,140
Here's some point p.

1448
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:49,910
We know there's 180
degrees of material.

1449
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:55,720
I mean, locally, everything's
flat in terms of the surface.

1450
01:06:55,720 --> 01:07:00,030
So here's where I'm going to
wave my hands a little bit.

1451
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:03,320
I claim that the
curvature vector

1452
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:10,700
must be perpendicular to
Tp and perpendicular to Sp.

1453
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:15,310
Because if I take this
curve, and I project it

1454
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:19,270
into one of these
planes, say Tp,

1455
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:25,560
it should be straight
at p in projection.

1456
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:29,011
It also must be straight
when I project into Sp.

1457
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:30,760
And that actually means
that it's straight

1458
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,444
in three dimensions also.

1459
01:07:32,444 --> 01:07:33,860
So the straightness
and projection

1460
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:36,666
corresponds to straightness
when flattened basically.

1461
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:39,430
I'm waving my
hands a little bit.

1462
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:43,370
But if I need the
curvature vector

1463
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:44,980
to be perpendicular
to this plane--

1464
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:47,720
so it's something like this.

1465
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,690
It's coming straight
out of this plane.

1466
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:52,670
But that uniquely
determines its direction.

1467
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:55,000
It also needs to be
perpendicular to Sp.

1468
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,590
These two vectors can't
be the same thing,

1469
01:07:57,590 --> 01:08:03,390
and yet they have to be, unless
these planes are the same.

1470
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:06,200
So it could be there's a zero
fold angle, then it's fine.

1471
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,960
Or it could be it's
180-degree fold angle,

1472
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,942
then again the
planes are the same.

1473
01:08:10,942 --> 01:08:13,680
Can go in one
direction or the other.

1474
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:19,540
But if I have a proper crease,
then there's no such vector.

1475
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:20,688
And so we're done.

1476
01:08:20,688 --> 01:08:22,479
That proves straight
creases stay straight.

1477
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:28,290

1478
01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:28,790
Cool.

1479
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:31,930

1480
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:33,320
Any questions about that?

1481
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:41,100

1482
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:43,170
So I'm trying to hit a
middle ground of not too

1483
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:48,350
technical but also
not too shallow.

1484
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:52,520
And so you're left in the middle
state of sort of make sense.

1485
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:55,666
But I did wave my hands,
and it's not super rigorous.

1486
01:08:55,666 --> 01:08:57,540
Because to be rigorous
it would take forever,

1487
01:08:57,540 --> 01:08:59,830
and I need to teach you
differential geometry and so

1488
01:08:59,830 --> 01:09:01,020
on.

1489
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:03,529
But now that we are
armed with these tools--

1490
01:09:03,529 --> 01:09:07,170
straight creases stay straight
and any polygonal boundary

1491
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:10,620
stays flat, planar--
that tells us

1492
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:12,870
that if we have
some crease pattern,

1493
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:20,319
any crease pattern made
out of straight edges,

1494
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:23,510
so no curve creases allowed,
if I make straight creases,

1495
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:28,550
every single interior
face must stay rigid

1496
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:32,010
in any proper folding.

1497
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:33,344
That's pretty cool.

1498
01:09:33,344 --> 01:09:35,760
Because we've talked about
rigid origami and said not much

1499
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:36,968
is known about rigid origami.

1500
01:09:36,968 --> 01:09:38,047
It's tough.

1501
01:09:38,047 --> 01:09:40,380
But in fact, you really need
to understand rigid origami

1502
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:43,200
if you want to fold something
like a hyperbolic paraboloid.

1503
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:47,000
Now, when you do flat
folding stuff-- well,

1504
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,460
I guess those are
kind of rigid also.

1505
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:53,100
But any kind of
3-dimensional folding,

1506
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:56,360
where you fold every crease
somewhat but not all the way,

1507
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:59,442
all the faces need to be
rigid in the final form.

1508
01:09:59,442 --> 01:10:01,400
Now, you could get there
by all sorts of means.

1509
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,120
But we want the
hyperbolic paraboloid

1510
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,500
to exist with creases
only along these lines.

1511
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:10,290
And now we know each of these
trapezoids must remain planar.

1512
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:13,640
Also, each of these
triangles must remain planar.

1513
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:17,060
Now, now we get to
the contradictions.

1514
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:18,930
If you have this piece
of paper and those

1515
01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:22,060
are your only creases,
you can fold along

1516
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:25,430
one of the creases or
the other, but not both.

1517
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:28,100
Unless you fold one crease
all the way to 180-- here,

1518
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,680
we can do it.

1519
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:35,440
I have one diagonal, and
I have another diagonal.

1520
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,220
So everything's
meeting at 180 degrees.

1521
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:39,290
I can fold one and
then the other.

1522
01:10:39,290 --> 01:10:41,680
I can fold one, or I
can fold the other.

1523
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:44,432
But I cannot fold a
little bit of one,

1524
01:10:44,432 --> 01:10:45,890
and then try to
fold the other too.

1525
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:48,210
It's not possible.

1526
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:51,680
Therefore, this crease
pattern doesn't fold at all.

1527
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:52,180
OK?

1528
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:53,780
Kind of trivial.

1529
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:55,480
The center is messed up.

1530
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,430
But keep in mind,
again, these faces

1531
01:10:57,430 --> 01:11:00,120
we don't know anything about
because this edge could

1532
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,790
do crazy things.

1533
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:03,750
But the interior faces
of the crease pattern

1534
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:06,740
must all stay flat
and stay exactly

1535
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:08,230
as they were in the original.

1536
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:10,940
So it's really like we
have rigid panels here

1537
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:12,090
and hinges between them.

1538
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:15,020
The outside, though, we
have no idea what happens.

1539
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:15,520
OK.

1540
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,500
So the inside sucks.

1541
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,510
So I think, at this point,
we get to this picture.

1542
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:21,170
Here's the regular
crease pattern.

1543
01:11:21,170 --> 01:11:23,720
So let's just make life
easier and say, well, we'll

1544
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,650
cut out a hole in the center.

1545
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:28,480
That surely-- that
must be better.

1546
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,680
But it's no better.

1547
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:33,390
That thing still
can't fold because you

1548
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:37,330
take any of the rings
that goes around,

1549
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:41,906
like a square annulus--
here's a ring.

1550
01:11:41,906 --> 01:11:44,460
The creases in that ring
are just those four.

1551
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:47,020
So I'm just looking at
these four trapezoids.

1552
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:49,730
Again, each one
must stay planar.

1553
01:11:49,730 --> 01:11:51,720
And these are the
only hinges I have.

1554
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:54,717
It's actually really
just like this.

1555
01:11:54,717 --> 01:11:56,800
I've cut a hole in the
center, but it won't really

1556
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:01,440
matter because the extension
of these lines meet at a point.

1557
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,370
So effectively, you are
folding this whole triangle.

1558
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:06,392
You can fold just the trapezoid.

1559
01:12:06,392 --> 01:12:07,850
But however you
fold the trapezoid,

1560
01:12:07,850 --> 01:12:09,850
you could just extend it
and make the triangle,

1561
01:12:09,850 --> 01:12:11,516
and these triangles
will remain meeting.

1562
01:12:11,516 --> 01:12:15,180
So it's actually the same
thing as the center diagram.

1563
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:17,650
Because this doesn't fold,
this also won't fold.

1564
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:19,640
It doesn't matter how
many layers you cut out.

1565
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:21,390
As long as there's one
interior layer that

1566
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:26,030
doesn't touch the boundary,
it's going to be screwed.

1567
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:27,940
OK.

1568
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:30,890
That is why
hyperbolic paraboloid

1569
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:33,410
doesn't fold without diagonals.

1570
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:36,610
Once you know the creases are
straight, it's kind of obvious.

1571
01:12:36,610 --> 01:12:40,660
But let me give you a
more general picture.

1572
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:43,270
This makes things a little
more interesting and tells you,

1573
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:44,770
really, all those
straight crease

1574
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:47,680
pleatings that I've shown you,
like hexagons and octagons,

1575
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:52,060
none of them are possible,
which was a surprise.

1576
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:54,290
So here I'm taking concentric
shapes in such a way

1577
01:12:54,290 --> 01:12:56,450
that the diagonals
meet at a point.

1578
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:57,580
I still need that fact.

1579
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:01,081
If they don't, in fact,
it's possible to fold.

1580
01:13:01,081 --> 01:13:02,850
And we have a little
example of that.

1581
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:10,410

1582
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:13,015
OK, now I actually
need two interior rings

1583
01:13:13,015 --> 01:13:15,610
to get a contradiction.

1584
01:13:15,610 --> 01:13:23,400
So I take some ring like
this, and I take another ring,

1585
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,754
and I suppose none of
them touch the boundary.

1586
01:13:25,754 --> 01:13:27,420
As long as I know
there's at least four,

1587
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:29,825
there's going to be two
consecutive rings like this.

1588
01:13:29,825 --> 01:13:38,980
And the hinges are the diagonals
and the inner ring boundaries.

1589
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:39,860
OK.

1590
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:47,960
If I just look locally at
this, I claim it must be

1591
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:51,970
mountain-mountain-mountain-valley
 or the reverse.

1592
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:54,310
This is something we would
normally prove by saying,

1593
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:56,677
OK, this is locally smallest,
therefore these guys

1594
01:13:56,677 --> 01:13:57,260
are different.

1595
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:58,676
And this is also
locally smallest,

1596
01:13:58,676 --> 01:14:00,764
therefore these guys are
different, and so on.

1597
01:14:00,764 --> 01:14:02,430
Except that only works
for flat folding.

1598
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:04,280
Here I need to prove
it for 3D folding.

1599
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:06,940
I'm not going to bother,
but you can do it.

1600
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:10,890
So in fact, let's say this is
 mountain-mountain-mountain-valley,

1601
01:14:10,890 --> 01:14:12,540
then this must be
mountain, this must,

1602
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:15,010
all the way around
must be mountain.

1603
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:15,510
OK?

1604
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:16,850
That's not such a big deal.

1605
01:14:16,850 --> 01:14:20,590
This must all be valley,
and this must all

1606
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:24,090
be mountain, or
the entire reverse.

1607
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:27,165
But the point is,
all of these guys

1608
01:14:27,165 --> 01:14:31,690
out here must be mountains.

1609
01:14:31,690 --> 01:14:34,030
So really if I extend
all of these guys

1610
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:36,620
and they meet at a single
point, if I was lucky,

1611
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:40,240
that's what I'm supposed to
assume, really what I'm doing

1612
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:44,390
is folding a whole
bunch of triangles

1613
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:47,310
where all of the
creases are mountains.

1614
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:48,900
That's not possible.

1615
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:52,064
So if you didn't
believe this thing,

1616
01:14:52,064 --> 01:14:53,480
it follows from
the same argument.

1617
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:56,035
They can't all be mountains,
and therefore some crease

1618
01:14:56,035 --> 01:14:58,030
is not getting folded.

1619
01:14:58,030 --> 01:15:00,850
So it's the same
argument again, you just

1620
01:15:00,850 --> 01:15:02,555
have to be a little
more precise.

1621
01:15:02,555 --> 01:15:05,180

1622
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:09,370
And that is not folding
hyperbolic paraboloids

1623
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:10,620
and things like that.

1624
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:12,890
But if you had
diagonals, it all works.

1625
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:15,740
Now, in the last few minutes, I
want to show you some more fun

1626
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:19,500
things, in particular, pillows.

1627
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:22,110
Everybody likes pillows.

1628
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:23,100
But how are they made?

1629
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:26,340
Well, it's like two
squares of material joined

1630
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:29,375
along the edges, and then
you stuff stuff inside.

1631
01:15:29,375 --> 01:15:31,500
That kind of weird, because
doubly-covered square I

1632
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:34,730
think of as flat, and yet
you can put material inside.

1633
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:39,040
What is the maximum volume
you can stuff into a pillow?

1634
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,590
This is called the
tea bag problem

1635
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:44,020
because it also works
for square tea bags.

1636
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:44,820
Open.

1637
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:45,460
We don't know.

1638
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:49,390
Lots of practical
explorations, but open.

1639
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:51,200
Another version of
this is Mylar balloons.

1640
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:54,240
Mylar balloons can't
stretch, more or less.

1641
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:57,480
And here is two
circles glued together.

1642
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,810
Again flat, but you
can pump air into them.

1643
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:02,680
You get this weird behavior,
these ripples on the outside.

1644
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,380
That's real stuff.

1645
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:06,820
But we don't know what the
maximum volume shape is,

1646
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:11,470
but it should look something
like what we see in reality.

1647
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:13,420
Let me tell you
some fun theorems.

1648
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:19,970
If you take any convex
polyhedron, like say a cube,

1649
01:16:19,970 --> 01:16:23,110
you can inflate it and
increase its volume.

1650
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:25,760
Also, I guess, works for
a doubly-covered square.

1651
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,430
This is the tea
bag open problem,

1652
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:30,760
where these edges are joined.

1653
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,010
How do you do it?

1654
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:34,040
I'm going to quote
from the paper--

1655
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,657
"by simultaneously
delivering karate chops

1656
01:16:36,657 --> 01:16:37,990
to the edges of the polyhedron."

1657
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:39,460
That's in the abstract.

1658
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:44,880
So you take an edge like
this-- here's an edge

1659
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:48,346
and the two incident
faces-- and I go like this.

1660
01:16:48,346 --> 01:16:50,570
Wow, that was exciting.

1661
01:16:50,570 --> 01:16:56,750
So what happens when you go like
this-- the whole board shakes,

1662
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:58,804
I'll probably break
it eventually--

1663
01:16:58,804 --> 01:16:59,970
you get something like that.

1664
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:02,540
So there's a valley
here, and then

1665
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:05,470
mountains there to
replace this mountain.

1666
01:17:05,470 --> 01:17:09,140
And you can prove, if you do
that with suitable parameters

1667
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:11,025
here, at every edge
simultaneously you

1668
01:17:11,025 --> 01:17:14,240
increase the volume,
which is pretty neat.

1669
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:16,600
Now, how far can you go?

1670
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,730
What happens when you keep
increasing the volume?

1671
01:17:18,730 --> 01:17:22,975
Is the limit polyhedral, or
is it smooth with ripples?

1672
01:17:22,975 --> 01:17:24,600
Conjecture is it's
smooth with ripples.

1673
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,391
In fact, you can prove
it's not polyhedral.

1674
01:17:26,391 --> 01:17:28,310
Because not only for
convex polyhedral,

1675
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:33,300
you take any polyhedron, it
is possible to inflate it

1676
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:34,650
by at least some volume.

1677
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:37,360
So the limit has to be curvy.

1678
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:40,214
It's not going to be polyhedral.

1679
01:17:40,214 --> 01:17:41,630
Now, exactly what
it looks like we

1680
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:45,780
don't know, but lots of
experiments to that effect.

1681
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:48,450

1682
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:52,190
A big open question in this
field is, does this exist?

1683
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:52,940
We think so.

1684
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:54,750
It seems curve creases--
none of this stuff

1685
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:56,280
works for curve creases.

1686
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,452
Curve creases seem
a lot more powerful.

1687
01:17:58,452 --> 01:18:00,160
We haven't been able
to prove this exists

1688
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,500
because it seems very flexible.

1689
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:03,000
There's a lot of
degrees of freedom.

1690
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,240
It's hard to figure out
where the rule lines are.

1691
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:08,710
But we think so.

1692
01:18:08,710 --> 01:18:09,940
So what about curved creases?

1693
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:11,440
I haven't talked
about curve creases

1694
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,710
really at all
until this lecture.

1695
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:20,590
I would say the most seminal
work in curve creases

1696
01:18:20,590 --> 01:18:22,660
was done by David Huffman.

1697
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:24,310
Huffman is super famous.

1698
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:29,870
He was a grad student
and a professor

1699
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:31,612
here at MIT for many years.

1700
01:18:31,612 --> 01:18:33,320
In particular, when
he was a grad student

1701
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:34,819
he came up with
these Huffman codes,

1702
01:18:34,819 --> 01:18:37,660
which are used in
every MP3 player.

1703
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:39,960
Every device you use that
uses any kind of compression

1704
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,165
has Huffman codes in it.

1705
01:18:41,165 --> 01:18:42,920
Super cool from the '60s.

1706
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:46,170
But he also did a lot
of curve crease origami,

1707
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:47,810
curve crease folding.

1708
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:51,480
And over the last
couple of years,

1709
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:56,190
we've been working with
his family, so his wife

1710
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:59,660
and two daughters,
Linda and Elise.

1711
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:02,288
And this is me,
that's Marty, and this

1712
01:19:02,288 --> 01:19:03,662
is Duks Koschitz,
who many of you

1713
01:19:03,662 --> 01:19:06,150
know is a PhD student
in architecture.

1714
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:09,160
And we were visiting there
back in May in particular.

1715
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:12,100
And what we're doing is
taking his work, which

1716
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:17,310
is all in their houses and
almost no one has seen,

1717
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:18,912
and figuring out
how he made them.

1718
01:19:18,912 --> 01:19:20,370
What is the underlying
mathematics?

1719
01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:23,220
What are the crease patterns
that make it possible?

1720
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:26,090
And then recreating them to
check that we did it right.

1721
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:29,880
So what I have here are just a
few examples of our recreations

1722
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:30,380
so far.

1723
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:31,921
So these are not
the original models,

1724
01:19:31,921 --> 01:19:33,810
but they look just like
the original models,

1725
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:36,839
made out of the same material
and more or less the same way.

1726
01:19:36,839 --> 01:19:38,880
Although we do it a little
more high-tech than he

1727
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:45,260
did because we want to draw
perfect computational diagrams

1728
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:47,262
in CAD, and then
reproduce them exactly

1729
01:19:47,262 --> 01:19:48,970
on the paper with no
reproduction errors.

1730
01:19:48,970 --> 01:19:56,150
So we use fancy
robotically-controlled devices

1731
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:57,550
to do that.

1732
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:59,500
So there's some
fun curve creases.

1733
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:02,160
You get some really
nice shadow patterns.

1734
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:06,630
All of those are circular
arcs, all the creases.

1735
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:07,770
Here are some more.

1736
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:11,640
These are actually parabolic
arcs and some straight creases

1737
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:12,595
in between.

1738
01:20:12,595 --> 01:20:14,440
Get some cool 3D relief effect.

1739
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:16,190
These are like
tessellations like Tom Hull

1740
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:17,898
was talking about but
with curve creases.

1741
01:20:17,898 --> 01:20:22,760

1742
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:23,890
This is pretty awesome.

1743
01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:27,360
Here the creases are quite
complicated to figure out.

1744
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:30,630
But what's happening is
you're taking a cone like this

1745
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:33,430
and pleating it back and forth
but with different angles,

1746
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:36,100
and so the whole thing twists.

1747
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:38,370
We have a physical one
of these in our offices.

1748
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:41,080
But this is the 3D model
of what's going on.

1749
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,710

1750
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:46,550
Here's some particularly
awesome crease patterns.

1751
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:49,550
David Huffman made a
whole variety of these.

1752
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:51,450
These are just a
couple of examples.

1753
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:52,985
Got some crazy circular arcs.

1754
01:20:52,985 --> 01:20:55,030
You've got some-- I
guess these are also

1755
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:57,520
circular arcs and some
straight segments.

1756
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:00,990
And then you wrap this
around to make a cylinder,

1757
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:04,300
and you get this.

1758
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:07,160
That one-- there's a bunch of
photos of the original David

1759
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:11,250
Huffman model on the web
if you Google around.

1760
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:16,090
Not looking exactly like that,
but there's a whole variety.

1761
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:17,814
Here's another one,
a bit of a maybe

1762
01:21:17,814 --> 01:21:18,980
surprise what it looks like.

1763
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:22,120
Most of the center just gets
eaten away from these creases.

1764
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,520
Here the creases are
elliptical, and you

1765
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,780
get something like that.

1766
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:29,761
So there's some hidden
structure beneath.

1767
01:21:29,761 --> 01:21:31,600
I think just one more example.

1768
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,140
This is probably the
most coolest puzzle.

1769
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:38,220
You say, well, you float along
these parabolas, just one

1770
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:40,430
valley and one mountain.

1771
01:21:40,430 --> 01:21:44,640
But you fold them a
lot, you get that.

1772
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:47,170
And Huffman composed
these to make

1773
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:50,100
various kinds of tubes
and really cool things.

1774
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:51,326
So this is work in progress.

1775
01:21:51,326 --> 01:21:52,700
Just wanted to
give you a sample.

1776
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:55,210
There's a paper about this
which shows more examples.

1777
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:58,350
But our goal is to recreate
all or most of them

1778
01:21:58,350 --> 01:22:02,640
and document how he
did it and figure out

1779
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,290
how he designed these models.

1780
01:22:04,290 --> 01:22:06,289
He had mathematical
tools to do this,

1781
01:22:06,289 --> 01:22:08,080
and we're still figuring
out what they are.

1782
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:13,000
The hope is it will lead to
more great mathematics and art

1783
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,780
about curve creases.

1784
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:15,990
And that is it.

1785
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:17,770
This is my last lecture.

1786
01:22:17,770 --> 01:22:21,480
Next class we have-- or
next three classes we

1787
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:23,501
have a whole bunch of
student presentations.

1788
01:22:23,501 --> 01:22:24,000
Please come.

1789
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,820
There will be lots of
awesome things there.

1790
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:27,240
Send me your slides
ahead of time,

1791
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:31,320
and you'll have 10 minutes
to do it, to give a talk.

1792
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:35,480
And then the last lecture,
Wednesday two weeks from now,

1793
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:37,220
is Tomohiro Tachi.

1794
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:38,420
And thanks very much.

1795
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:40,330
It's been a lot of
fun doing this class

1796
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:41,621
and having you all as students.

1797
01:22:41,621 --> 01:22:44,420
[APPLAUSE]
