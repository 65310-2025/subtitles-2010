0-1:59:59,500 --> 00:00:02,285

2
00:00:02,285 --> 00:00:03,160
PROFESSOR: All right.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,270
Welcome back to 6.849.

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:12,030
You may recall or have heard
that this film crew from Japan

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,880
is here.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,890
They're from a program
called Gachan!,

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,647
which is about showing
all the cool things

8
00:00:16,647 --> 00:00:18,480
that happen in universities
around the world

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,360
to students in Japan.

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,000
So don't mind them,
but you're going

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,116
to have to sign a
release form at the end.

12
00:00:25,116 --> 00:00:27,240
I apparently don't need
you to sign a release form.

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:27,880
It just works.

14
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,944

15
00:00:32,944 --> 00:00:34,360
We're talking about
origami today.

16
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,350
We began a series of lectures
on computational origami.

17
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,830
We're going to do some
design, some actual folding,

18
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:46,580
and some foldability
algorithm stuff.

19
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:53,730
Does everyone have one of these
strips and a square of paper?

20
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,510
You don't.

21
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,450
Who has the master?

22
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,880
Why don't you grab a few?

23
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,550
Some of these.

24
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,680
Here's the package.

25
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,280

26
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,501
Lots of stuff.

27
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,640
The paper comes from
the Gachan! team,

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,150
so thanks to them.

29
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,370
This is stuff you use in
your adding machine, I guess.

30
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,130
That's where it comes from.

31
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:20,720
Yes.

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,595
You need one of each.

33
00:01:21,595 --> 00:01:22,305
Go for it.

34
00:01:22,305 --> 00:01:23,610
Open it.

35
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,290
Let's get started.

36
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,495
Where is my chalk?

37
00:01:26,495 --> 00:01:30,080

38
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,660
So just to warm you up,
I want to do some folding

39
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,310
and give you some terminology.

40
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,780
I know some of you have
done origami before,

41
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,420
but a lot of you
haven't, so bear with me.

42
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,252
I will try to do this quickly.

43
00:01:47,252 --> 00:01:48,960
And even for those
who have done origami,

44
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,040
you may not have done
origami math before.

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,310
That's why you're here.

46
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,440
So things like a
piece of paper, which

47
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,500
you might take for
granted, I'm going

48
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,360
to define here to
be a 2D polygon.

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,380
There's actually many
interesting definitions

50
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,630
of a piece of paper,
but for today at least,

51
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,610
most of the time, we'll
think about polygon.

52
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,526
Usually, you think of a
square piece of paper,

53
00:02:11,526 --> 00:02:14,940
but "polygon" would be the
geometer's generalization

54
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,500
of that.

55
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,455
Also, the polygon has
distinguished sides.

56
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:24,320

57
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,470
So distinguished
top and bottom side.

58
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:36,050
In practice, with standard
kami paper from Japan,

59
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,207
you have the colored
side and the white side,

60
00:02:38,207 --> 00:02:39,540
so that's one clear distinction.

61
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,200
Maybe we call the
colored side the top.

62
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,580
Doesn't really matter, just
so we can tell things apart,

63
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,220
and in particular tell
mountains from valleys.

64
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,620
That's our motivation.

65
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:55,230
So a crease in a piece
of paper, this I'm

66
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:00,130
going to think abstractly as
just a line segment or some one

67
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,825
dimensional curve drawn
on the piece of paper.

68
00:03:05,825 --> 00:03:12,720

69
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,260
And then we have crease pattern.

70
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,630

71
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,680
This is just a bunch of creases,
so a bunch of line segments

72
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,360
drawn on the piece of paper.

73
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,120
If you are graph
theoretically inclined,

74
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,880
I would think of
this as a planar

75
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:42,135
graph drawn on the paper.

76
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:45,089

77
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:46,880
If you're not graph
theoretically inclined,

78
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,840
just ignore that definition.

79
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,400
They're the same thing.

80
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,630
That's a crease pattern.

81
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,590
So for example, the thing
we're going to be folding

82
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,770
is this very simple
pinwheel, and this

83
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,260
is an example of a
crease pattern that

84
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,140
folds into that pinwheel.

85
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,037
So here, the lines
are distinguished.

86
00:04:10,037 --> 00:04:12,620
There's two different kinds, the
red lines and the blue lines,

87
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,061
but ignore that for now.

88
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:15,519
That's a bunch of
creases which you

89
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,899
could put in and
make that thing.

90
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:20,269

91
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:24,320
Before we get there, I want
the notion of a folded state.

92
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,710

93
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,240
So this is all pretty normal
if you're an origamist.

94
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,390
This is really something
only the mathematicians use,

95
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,130
this term, folded state.

96
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,540

97
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,925
Informally, this is what we refer
to as the finished product.

98
00:04:45,925 --> 00:04:49,300

99
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,960
This pinwheel is a folded
state of this piece of paper.

100
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,970
Clear?

101
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,100
Defining that is a real pain,
and you can look at chapter 11,

102
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,410
I think, in the textbook.

103
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,740
Maybe I'll talk about
it at some point,

104
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,156
but I don't want
to get distracted

105
00:05:02,156 --> 00:05:04,040
by how you define what
a folded state is.

106
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,456
But you're not
allowed to stretch,

107
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:07,300
you're not allowed to tear.

108
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,850
It should be a
nice, valid folding.

109
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,630
You can't cross yourself.

110
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:15,030
So that's this notion
of folded state.

111
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:21,460
And if you take a folded
state and then unfold it--

112
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,690
this is something you can
do with a folded state--

113
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,920
you get a crease pattern.

114
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,920

115
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,360
So I can take this
pinwheel, unfold it,

116
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,260
and I can see which
lines are creased

117
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,220
to make that pinwheel happen.

118
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:47,040
So that's the crease
pattern of a folded state.

119
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,740
Today especially, and
a lot of the field

120
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,060
is concerned with the idea
of flat foldings, which

121
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:03,980
are a particular kind of folded
state that lives in the plane,

122
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,825
lying in the plane.

123
00:06:04,825 --> 00:06:08,529

124
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:10,570
Of course, it doesn't
literally lie on the plane.

125
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,090
There's lots of layers
stacked on top of each other,

126
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,870
but geometrically,
everything has

127
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,960
been collapsed onto one
slightly thickened plane here.

128
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,160
So this is a flat origami.

129
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,340
This is also a flat
origami, the trivial kind.

130
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,900
That's a flat folding.

131
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:34,020
And when this is possible,
we call that crease pattern

132
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,020
flat foldable.

133
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:47,350

134
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,880
And finally, we get to the
idea of mountains and valleys.

135
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:05,120
So a mountain crease is
when the bottom sides

136
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:17,100
touch, and a valley crease
is when the top sides touch.

137
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,390

138
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,320
So remember my
distinguished sides.

139
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,340
I'll call the
colored side the top,

140
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,010
so then this is a
mountain crease over here

141
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,620
because I'm bringing the
two white sides together,

142
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,920
and where's a valley?

143
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,770
I guess this is a valley, where
I'm bringing the two colored

144
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,050
sides, the two top
sides, together.

145
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,560
Together, that
makes this pattern,

146
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,120
and hopefully, that
matches up with here.

147
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,160
I mean, it's symmetric.

148
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,451
You could flip everything over.

149
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:49,465
You'd just get the
inverted color pattern.

150
00:07:49,465 --> 00:07:51,966
It doesn't really matter which
side you defined to be which,

151
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:53,506
but the point is to
distinguish which

152
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,210
are mountains versus
which are valleys.

153
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,130
You get different
parity, it looks

154
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,140
like, I have matched up there.

155
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,760
So let's fold this, just
for some experience,

156
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,090
if you've never made one before.

157
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,470
Take your square piece of
paper, and to get started,

158
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,090
let's say with
the white side up,

159
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,410
just fold along
the two diagonals,

160
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,390
the valley folds, bringing
the two white sides together.

161
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,160

162
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,834
So you fold along one
diagonal, then you unfold, then

163
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:27,250
you fold along the
other diagonal.

164
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:37,150

165
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,650
How are we doing?

166
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,654
Couple diagonals.

167
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:41,659
I have the big sheet.

168
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:42,700
I should be going slower.

169
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,360

170
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,330
So now, I want to fold
that inner square,

171
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,310
and we've conveniently
marked the center point.

172
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,540
So I'm going to fold each of
the four edges of the square

173
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,910
to the center, and
make sure to line up

174
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,895
the left and right edges,
and that guarantees that I

175
00:08:57,895 --> 00:09:00,970
fold parallel to
that bottom edge.

176
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,510
In this case, I
just want to crease

177
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,120
the middle half of that line.

178
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,870
So I'm not creasing all the way.

179
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,590
I'm just creasing
in the middle half

180
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,240
here to make that one
edge of the square,

181
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,365
and then I turn and I
repeat that four times.

182
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:30,130

183
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,180
Switch sides for
different visibility.

184
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:45,430

185
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,160
This is not the usual
way to teach this model,

186
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,050
but I think it's the
mathematically appropriate way.

187
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,200
I'm trying to make that crease
pattern as quickly as I can.

188
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,180
I did it with the white
side up because I'm

189
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,002
folding everything
valley, which is easier.

190
00:09:59,002 --> 00:10:00,710
In reality, I want
these to be mountains.

191
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,310
When I turn them over, they're
all mountains, and I'm happy.

192
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,262
We made some extra creases
here, which we didn't need to.

193
00:10:08,262 --> 00:10:08,970
How are we doing?

194
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,310
How many people are
done with those?

195
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,640
How many people are not?

196
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,810
Couple people.

197
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,360
Sarah, hurry up.

198
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,630
Now comes the fun
part, and this is

199
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,890
to give you an idea of what
general origami folds can

200
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:24,390
be like.

201
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,110
I want to simultaneously
fold all those creases

202
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,810
that I put in except
for the center, where

203
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,390
it's supposed to be uncreased.

204
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:36,760
So I'm going to bring those
four edges of the square in,

205
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,630
and if you do it
right, you'll end up

206
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,600
with these four flaps
sticking out of the top.

207
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,040
It's not going to lie flat.

208
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,570
We don't have enough
creases in yet.

209
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,560
But we have these four
flaps of the pinwheel,

210
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,640
and then you just
get to choose, do I

211
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,750
flip them over one
way or the other?

212
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,360
If you flip them over as much
as they go in that direction--

213
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,365
I'll try to match the figure.

214
00:10:58,365 --> 00:11:00,200
I'll put this guy
over at the left,

215
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:07,790
crease him in, put this guy
down at that end, and this guy

216
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:13,650
over to the right,
and this guy up.

217
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,960
I get my pinwheel.

218
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,010
If that doesn't work out
for you, you can try again.

219
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,050
It's not so hard, but
it gives you some idea

220
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,980
that putting all these
creases in at once

221
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,230
is kind of necessary
for this to happen.

222
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,980
In particular, if you
look at the crease pattern

223
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,600
of this model, there
is no fold that

224
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,410
goes all the way
through the square,

225
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,392
so you can't make a
first fold and then

226
00:11:38,392 --> 00:11:39,600
make a second fold and so on.

227
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,929
You really have to
do this all at once.

228
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:44,470
There's many ways to do it, some
of which are more intuitive,

229
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,600
but I thought this simultaneous
collapse is the coolest.

230
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,085
It's nice and four-fold
symmetric as you do it, I guess,

231
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,440
if you do it right.

232
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,910
I think this even folds rigidly.

233
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,700
That's to give you
some intuition,

234
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,995
some real, practical
origami experience.

235
00:12:00,995 --> 00:12:05,210

236
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,630
And you get an idea of
what a crease pattern is,

237
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,350
what a mountain/valley is.

238
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,240
I have two more
terms and then we

239
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,305
can go to math, some real stuff.

240
00:12:13,305 --> 00:12:19,900

241
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,930
There's two notions that
involve mountains and valleys.

242
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:31,384
One is a mountain-valley
assignment,

243
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,050
and this is something
that goes together

244
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,860
with the crease pattern.

245
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,359
And this specifies which
creases are mountains

246
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,275
and which are valleys.

247
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:48,402

248
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:50,990
Did you all get it?

249
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,700
Good.

250
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,830
The pinwheel, I mean.

251
00:12:52,830 --> 00:13:00,390

252
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,050
So you could think of this
as a coloring of the edges,

253
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:03,760
whatever.

254
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,090
In this case, I'm
simultaneously using color red

255
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,700
to denote mountains and
blue to denote valleys,

256
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,210
and also, the standard
in origami world,

257
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,560
although it's a bit
annoying, is dot dash

258
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,635
means mountain and
dash means valley.

259
00:13:17,635 --> 00:13:18,510
That's pretty common.

260
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:22,240
You'll see that throughout.

261
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:32,350
That was invented in the
1950s, I guess, by Yoshizawa,

262
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,662
maybe earlier.

263
00:13:33,662 --> 00:13:34,620
Somewhere around there.

264
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,160

265
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,130
And then if I take a
crease pattern together

266
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,546
with a mountain-valley
assignment,

267
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:43,120
I'm going to call this a
mountain-valley pattern.

268
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,832
That's the picture that
I'm really drawing here.

269
00:13:46,832 --> 00:13:49,290
Sometimes it's useful to think
of these as coming together,

270
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,830
sometimes as separate.

271
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,590
You're going to see this
terminology all over the place,

272
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:57,840
so I figure I should define it.

273
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:07,230

274
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,470
And sometimes, M is
mountain, V is valley.

275
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,830

276
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,060
Now we can do some fun stuff.

277
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,507

278
00:14:20,507 --> 00:14:22,090
I showed you this
pinwheel to give you

279
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,720
an idea of more
complicated folds,

280
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,450
the general origami folds.

281
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,640
But today, I want to focus
on relatively simple kind

282
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,500
of folds, which is
called simple folds.

283
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,960

284
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,360
Unlike this thing where I have
to simultaneously collapse

285
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,010
many creases, a simple fold
just involves one crease.

286
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:55,040
It is a fold along
a single line,

287
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,470
and we fold it by plus
or minus 180 degrees.

288
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,940
So depending which
way you're counting,

289
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,020
plus 180 is maybe valley,
minus 180 is mountain.

290
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,900

291
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,350
If I start with a flat folding,
after I make a simple fold,

292
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,306
I will again have
a flat folding.

293
00:15:13,306 --> 00:15:14,680
What we're interested
in is, what

294
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,540
can you make by a
sequence of simple folds?

295
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,210
I start from a
square paper, say,

296
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,140
and I make a sequence
of simple folds.

297
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,380
At all times, I will
be flat folding.

298
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,352
It's easy to get there.

299
00:15:24,352 --> 00:15:26,810
The pinwheel is something you
could not make in this model.

300
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,870
It's a restricted
model, but it's still

301
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,000
surprisingly powerful.

302
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,500
You still get a
universality result.

303
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,400
Even with simple folds, you
can make any flat thing.

304
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,410
And if you relax this
constraint and don't

305
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,990
say it's plus or
minus 180, then you

306
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,520
can actually make any
3D thing you want.

307
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,000
So that's the first thing
we will prove today,

308
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,010
and that's in the
origami design world.

309
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,050
And then we'll go to
origami foldability.

310
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,341
I'll give you a crease pattern.

311
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:54,520
I want to know, can it be folded
by a sequence of simple folds?

312
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,080
That's a much harder problem,
but some cases are easy.

313
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:20,830

314
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:24,990
So this the universality result
I mentioned in lecture one.

315
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,030
This is going to be the
inefficient version,

316
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,270
but we're going to
prove that everything

317
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,136
can be folded from
a square paper.

318
00:16:32,136 --> 00:16:33,760
I'm going to be more
precise about what

319
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,634
I mean by everything.

320
00:16:34,634 --> 00:16:46,920

321
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,760
So I'm going to imagine there
are a bunch of polygons in 3D

322
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,310
and they're somehow
joined together

323
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,030
into one connected mass.

324
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,920
This could be a
polyhedron like a cube,

325
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,870
it could be a
polyhedron like a bunny,

326
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,010
it could be some
crazy, thorny mess,

327
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,605
but each piece
locally is a polygon,

328
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,271
and you just stick a
whole bunch of them

329
00:17:04,271 --> 00:17:07,790
together to some
connected thing.

330
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:14,579
Plus you get to specify what
color, what side of the paper

331
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:17,939
you want to be visible on
each of those polygons.

332
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:24,740

333
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,770
You can even do that on
each side of the polygon

334
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:30,270
if you want.

335
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:35,470

336
00:17:35,470 --> 00:18:14,100
And you can fold that thing from
a big enough piece of paper,

337
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,090
such as a big enough square, a
big enough rectangle, whatever

338
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,732
you feel like.

339
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:22,490
Bicolor paper here
refers to the idea

340
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,060
that your paper is
different colors

341
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,610
on one side and the other,
so white on one side,

342
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,204
colored on the other
side, white on one side,

343
00:18:31,204 --> 00:18:32,620
black on the other
side, whatever.

344
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:39,850
We usually try to draw that
with the folded over corner.

345
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:43,350

346
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,910
There we go, bicolor paper.

347
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:51,480
So for example,
for fun, here's how

348
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,526
you could imagine-- This
is a design by John Montroll.

349
00:18:54,526 --> 00:18:56,900
This is folded from a square
of paper, white on one side,

350
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,691
black on the other.

351
00:18:57,691 --> 00:18:59,600
It's a zebra.

352
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,490
And you could imagine
the input to that

353
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,110
problem was a bunch of polygons.

354
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,650
There's some white polygons,
some black polygons.

355
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,620
Together, they form
a connected union,

356
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,840
and that could be the input.

357
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,270
This could be an output to
how you fold your square

358
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,544
to make that color pattern.

359
00:19:15,544 --> 00:19:17,710
Of course, if you gave this
input to that algorithm,

360
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,570
you'll get a much uglier
folding than the one designed

361
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,094
by a human, but that's the idea.

362
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:24,510
You could also
imagine you're just

363
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,340
given a polygon
you want to make.

364
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,620
You say, I want to make
a horse, a flat horse.

365
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,770
Then you could give
that to this algorithm

366
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,250
and it will tell you
how to fold a horse.

367
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,440
That's the general idea.

368
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,150

369
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,336
So how do we prove that?

370
00:19:42,336 --> 00:19:43,335
Want to make everything.

371
00:19:43,335 --> 00:19:55,750

372
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,360
So this is an early result in
computational origami design,

373
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,065
I think from 1998, probably.

374
00:20:02,065 --> 00:20:07,600
Journal version here is in 2000.

375
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,340
Any ideas how to prove this?

376
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,209
How can we make anything?

377
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:14,750
Got to get you
thinking a little bit.

378
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:21,070

379
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:24,620
We have a subtle hint.

380
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:29,710
So the idea is to take
a really long strip,

381
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,910
much longer than this
one, and fold it, and just

382
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:37,270
wrap around your polyhedron
over and over and over,

383
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,310
and eventually make
whatever you want.

384
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,300
So it's going to
be a little flimsy,

385
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,230
but mathematically,
it'll work perfectly.

386
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:51,430
So first thing to do is
fold your paper, whatever

387
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:57,735
shape it is, down to a
long, narrow strip, so

388
00:20:57,735 --> 00:20:58,955
a long, narrow rectangle.

389
00:20:58,955 --> 00:21:09,650

390
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,030
Conveniently, you have your
strips of paper already,

391
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,030
but if you started
with a square,

392
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,946
the first thing you'd
do is accordion pleat it

393
00:21:14,946 --> 00:21:17,890
down to just one
edge of the square.

394
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:18,639
Crazy already.

395
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:20,680
If you started with a
square, this is a bad idea.

396
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,610
If you started with a strip,
it's actually pretty good.

397
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:27,020
It's probably close to optimal.

398
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,650
But now, how do I actually, say,
wrap everything with the strip?

399
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,537
Let's be more formal about that.

400
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:34,120
The first thing I'm
going to do, which

401
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,650
is a common trick in
computational geometry,

402
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,460
it's like, well,
polygons are confusing.

403
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,480
I like triangles better.

404
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,720
They're much simpler.

405
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,700
So just triangulate
all the polygons.

406
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,920
If I have some crazy
polygon, imagine

407
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,060
that's some piece
of the zebra, I'll

408
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,435
just subdivide it
into triangles.

409
00:21:57,435 --> 00:21:59,060
There's standard
algorithms to do this.

410
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,268
I don't want to go into that.

411
00:22:00,268 --> 00:22:03,600
You can just add a bunch of
these diagonals to the polygon,

412
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,320
just keep adding them as long
as they don't cross each other.

413
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,750
When you're done, it
will be triangulated.

414
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,518
You can do that efficiently,
linear time, even.

415
00:22:11,518 --> 00:22:14,381

416
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:16,130
That's a little bit
easier to think about.

417
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,530
Now I just have to figure
out how to wrap one triangle

418
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:23,066
and then how to combine those
wrappings together somehow.

419
00:22:23,066 --> 00:22:24,940
Then I could go through
triangle by triangle,

420
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,460
visit everything, cover
everything I need to cover.

421
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,740
So that's what
we're going to do.

422
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,380

423
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:41,230
Cover each of these
triangles in some order.

424
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:44,130
We're going to cover
each one at least once,

425
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,680
possibly more if
we're not careful.

426
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,460
For starters, we'll
be not careful.

427
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:56,150

428
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:06,660
And we're going to do this
by using a zigzag path

429
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:14,640
parallel to the
next edge starting

430
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,120
from the opposite corner.

431
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,970
So some technical details.

432
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:24,300
Much easier to see in a picture,
so let me draw you a picture.

433
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:32,040

434
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,050
Let's say we want to
visit this triangle first,

435
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,567
and after we visit
this triangle,

436
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:38,150
let's say we've
planned out that we're

437
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,880
going to visit
this triangle next.

438
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,800
After that one, we're going
to go to this triangle.

439
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,990
So this is what I'd call
the next edge, because it's

440
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,410
the edge connecting
to the next triangle.

441
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,810
So I'd like to zigzag
parallel to this edge,

442
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,980
so I want to go back
and forth like that.

443
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,730
And then it says I want to start
at the opposite corner, which

444
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,720
is this one.

445
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,220
So I'm going to
start here, and I'll

446
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,636
draw this a little
more precisely.

447
00:24:02,636 --> 00:24:06,240

448
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,590
I'm going to take
my strip and just

449
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:14,270
go this way for a little while,
and turn around and come back

450
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:19,090
this way, and then
turn around, and we're

451
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,920
going to see how to do
turning around in a moment, so

452
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,080
something like that.

453
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,060

454
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,930
Now I've got to start planning
a little bit, because I want

455
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,710
to do this triangle in the same
way, meaning I want to go back

456
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,880
and forth parallel
to the next edge

457
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,020
starting at the opposite corner.

458
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,460
So that means next thing I want
to do is start at this corner,

459
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,200
so I need to set this up
so that I don't end here.

460
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,630
I'd like to end here.

461
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:52,400
You can do that just by
doing one more iteration.

462
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,670
If I end up with the
wrong parity-- here

463
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,785
it looks like I won't too much.

464
00:24:56,785 --> 00:24:59,450

465
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,780
Here it's a little ugly.

466
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,390
Got a little bit of uncovered
portion of the triangle,

467
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:06,830
so you need a slightly
different turn here.

468
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:10,140
Then I'll just come and
sort of overlap myself.

469
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,650
That's OK.

470
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,000
I just have to cover
it at least once.

471
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,510
And then I do some
kind of turn here,

472
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,022
and then I'm going to do this.

473
00:25:19,022 --> 00:25:20,730
So there's obviously
some questions here.

474
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,790
How do I make these
180 degree turns?

475
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,430
How do I make an arbitrary turn?

476
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,810
How do I turn even when I'm
allowed to overlap myself?

477
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,601
I'm not going to worry
about that too much,

478
00:25:28,601 --> 00:25:29,860
basically the same.

479
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,050
Basically, how do I turn?

480
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:33,720
How do I turn?

481
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:39,940
Well, let's take our
strips and do some turning,

482
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:45,640
and I have a slide
to follow along.

483
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:52,470
I have a big strip,
a little bit too big.

484
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:55,520
So the idea is you
have your strip,

485
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,460
you're gone merrily along,
and at some point you decide,

486
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,970
oh, I really need to
make a 132 degree turn.

487
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,124
I mean, it could be
anything because here, we've

488
00:26:04,124 --> 00:26:05,290
got to make some crazy turn.

489
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,010
We don't know what
the amount is.

490
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,980
So the turn gadget
is always the same.

491
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,159
You start out by making a
mountain fold perpendicular

492
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:12,700
to the strip.

493
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,840

494
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,485
So just fold in
half, so to speak.

495
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:18,985
Of course, half of
this is connected

496
00:26:18,985 --> 00:26:20,720
to everything you built already.

497
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,470
The other half, you don't know.

498
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:26,510
And then you take the back layer
and fold it to whatever angle

499
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,010
you want.

500
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:31,240
You have this degree of freedom
wherever you want to put it.

501
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,870
So for example, if we wanted
to make an obtuse angle.

502
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,790
I'm always going to fold
incident to that bottom corner.

503
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:39,670

504
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,840
It's a little hard to
handle, but you get the idea.

505
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,660
That's a nice, perfect
turn right there.

506
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,580
Looks even cooler on my side.

507
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,290
You just see the angular
bisector or something.

508
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,270
So that's a decent obtuse angle.

509
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,950
Things are little bit uglier
when you make an acute angle,

510
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,610
something like this.

511
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,790
You could make whatever
angle you want.

512
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,290
You should have
enough strip to make

513
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:08,560
several turns if
you feel like it.

514
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,622
If I make an acute angle like
this, I get some overhang.

515
00:27:11,622 --> 00:27:13,830
So I have what I want, which
is the strip coming here

516
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:17,420
and the strip coming
here at the extremes,

517
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,480
but over in this corner I
have some extra material,

518
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,620
and it could be a lot.

519
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,820
But whatever it is,
I'll just rid of it

520
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,110
by folding it
underneath repeatedly.

521
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,890
In this case, one
fold, it's gone.

522
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,770
In general, when
I make that fold,

523
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:35,720
it might come out over here and
I have to wrap around that cone

524
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,340
several times.

525
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,180
There's probably an
example of that here.

526
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,350
This figure in the
middle version,

527
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:46,590
you start just the same by
folding a super acute angle.

528
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:49,240
I fold that corner over and
it overhangs a little bit

529
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,190
on the bottom,
but it got tinier.

530
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,940
And if you just wrap
it around the corner,

531
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,830
eventually it will disappear and
you have exactly what you want,

532
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,038
which is a strip coming
horizontally and then a strip

533
00:27:58,038 --> 00:28:01,730
coming off diagonally at
whatever angle you wanted.

534
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,124
So that's really easy.

535
00:28:03,124 --> 00:28:04,540
That's what we
call a turn gadget.

536
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:13,180

537
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,415
So we do this
using turn gadgets.

538
00:28:15,415 --> 00:28:19,470

539
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,520
Now, you can't actually turn
with 180 degree angle here,

540
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,550
which is why in
this picture, what I

541
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:29,710
drew was a 90 degree turn and
then another 90 degree turn.

542
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,820
You can do that
however you want.

543
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,430
That's one way.

544
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:36,890
In fact, the way I've shown
it, it would be orthogonal,

545
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:40,700
but doesn't really matter.

546
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,850
These turns are not much harder.

547
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,810
You just do one or two of
those turns to get aligned.

548
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:50,010
And you can decide here, do
I turn around to the left

549
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:53,909
or do I turn around to the
right, and then I zigzag?

550
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:55,950
Depending on which way I
go, I will end up either

551
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,450
at this corner or this corner,
and if my next triangle's

552
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,850
up here, then I want to
end up at this corner.

553
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,830
If my next triangle's
over here, then I

554
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:05,640
want to end up at this corner.

555
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,690
You plan out ahead of
time what order you're

556
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:10,340
going to visit the
triangles, just decide.

557
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,590
Technically, it's like the
traveling salesman problem,

558
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,620
but you don't have to be
efficient at the moment.

559
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,130
We're not worrying
about efficiency.

560
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,600
Just visit triangle after
triangle, keep going to one

561
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,760
you haven't visited before.

562
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,010
It could be far away from you.

563
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,730
Maybe you have to go over
many triangles you visited

564
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,960
before, but eventually
you'll get to one

565
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,400
you haven't visited until
you're done, and then boom,

566
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,130
you've made anything.

567
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,210
Amazing.

568
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,330
We haven't quite
proved the theorem.

569
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:37,770
At this point, we can make any
connected union of polygons.

570
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,610
This is one polygon,
but if you're

571
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:44,150
in 3D, when you cross over
from one polygon to the next,

572
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,964
you might have to bend it at
some angle that's not flat,

573
00:29:46,964 --> 00:29:48,630
but then you can make
any 3D thing, too.

574
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,357
Yeah?

575
00:29:49,357 --> 00:29:51,925
AUDIENCE: When you wrap around
the triangle whose edge type

576
00:29:51,925 --> 00:29:54,260
is the bottom, how
do you do that when

577
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,900
the top left triangle is there?

578
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,770
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

579
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,471
When I wrap around here?

580
00:29:58,471 --> 00:30:01,072
AUDIENCE: No, the triangle
whose edge is the bottom edge.

581
00:30:01,072 --> 00:30:01,905
PROFESSOR: This one?

582
00:30:01,905 --> 00:30:02,530
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

583
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,419
How do you do that,
given that there's

584
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:07,120
the triangle in the top left?

585
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,944
PROFESSOR: Oh, I see.

586
00:30:09,944 --> 00:30:11,360
The question is,
what do I do here

587
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,550
because I'm going to overlap
into this triangle again?

588
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,216
AUDIENCE: Right.

589
00:30:14,216 --> 00:30:14,890
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

590
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,723
So you have to be a
little bit careful here,

591
00:30:16,723 --> 00:30:19,390
and there's one other gadget
I need to mention here,

592
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:23,590
which is the hide gadget,
I think it's called.

593
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,977

594
00:30:26,977 --> 00:30:28,810
Because I didn't fold
exactly this triangle,

595
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,680
I folded too much.

596
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,540
At this point when I have the
strip here, and maybe a little

597
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,640
bit out of the way,
I'd like to get rid

598
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,970
of all this messy stuff,
just tuck it underneath.

599
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,720
So I'm going to fold along this
line, fold all this stuff back

600
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,800
behind, and that might still be
a mess because it could stick

601
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,040
out over here or somewhere else.

602
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,760
So let me tell you about the
hide gadget a little bit,

603
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,840
maybe over here.

604
00:30:53,840 --> 00:31:01,530

605
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,450
You have to be a little careful
when you do that exactly,

606
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,500
but it's not that hard.

607
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:12,500

608
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:23,270
So in general,
the hide gadget is

609
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,800
you have some convex polygon.

610
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,370
Here, it's always going to
be a triangle, actually,

611
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:31,110
but this would work
for any convex polygon.

612
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:34,520
You have some folding which
contains that polygon,

613
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,680
but it might go outside
all over the place.

614
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,019
That's our situation.

615
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:38,935
We want this triangle.

616
00:31:38,935 --> 00:31:40,820
We have a folding that
includes the triangle

617
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,790
but it has all this
junk on the outside.

618
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,960
All you need to do is
repeatedly fold along

619
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,090
the extension of
each of these edges,

620
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:52,680
and you can prove-- I'm
not going to do it here

621
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,600
because it's a
little bit messy--

622
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,460
but as you fold that
thing, obviously

623
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,140
the area that you go
outside gets smaller,

624
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,940
and you do make steady
progress and eventually,

625
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,317
after finitely many folds,
you will have reduced

626
00:32:05,317 --> 00:32:06,900
this thing down to
the convex polygon.

627
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,070
Just keep folding mountain
fold along each of those edges.

628
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,780

629
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:16,024
And I think there's even
a pseudopolynomial bound

630
00:32:16,024 --> 00:32:17,690
on the number of folds
you need to make,

631
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:20,190
although I won't
go into that here.

632
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,532

633
00:32:23,532 --> 00:32:25,240
So that's what you do
with this triangle.

634
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,440
Then you fold the next one, and
then you apply the hide gadget

635
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,610
to that triangle.

636
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:36,062
When you do that, there is
this triangle in the way.

637
00:32:36,062 --> 00:32:37,770
Technically, I guess,
that wouldn't quite

638
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:40,600
be simple folds because you're
folding along this line.

639
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,100
You need to tuck it
in between the layers.

640
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,370
You have to avoid collision
with this triangle

641
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,490
and go underneath this one.

642
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:47,990
Hm.

643
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,805
I hadn't thought about that.

644
00:32:49,805 --> 00:32:51,680
I'd like to say this
works with simple folds.

645
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,570

646
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,840
It sort of does in that
each fold you make,

647
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,990
you're just folding
along one line at a time,

648
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,060
but you do actually
collide in the middle.

649
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,600
It's not so ideal.

650
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,550
Origami folds, this
definitely works.

651
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:11,320
I wonder if there's a way to
do it with simple folds now.

652
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:11,820
Interesting.

653
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,416

654
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:15,916
Hm.

655
00:33:15,916 --> 00:33:16,892
I don't know.

656
00:33:16,892 --> 00:33:20,796
AUDIENCE: Can you
undo the corner gadget

657
00:33:20,796 --> 00:33:23,724
to separate the
triangles, hide the folds,

658
00:33:23,724 --> 00:33:26,455
and then put them back?

659
00:33:26,455 --> 00:33:28,950
PROFESSOR: The question is,
can I pull them apart, do them

660
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,630
separately, and push
them back together?

661
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:33,088
Pulling them apart and pushing
them back together would not

662
00:33:33,088 --> 00:33:34,350
be simple folds, I think.

663
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,320
Maybe you could do it.

664
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,903
AUDIENCE: You just
have a pleat.

665
00:33:36,903 --> 00:33:37,930
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

666
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:38,715
Interesting.

667
00:33:38,715 --> 00:33:39,840
We should think about that.

668
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,450
I'm surprised this is not
known, but I'm pretty sure

669
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:45,690
now that it's not known.

670
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,250
Maybe first open
problem session,

671
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,657
we can solve that
in a few minutes.

672
00:33:49,657 --> 00:33:50,365
Should be doable.

673
00:33:50,365 --> 00:33:56,200

674
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,130
There's one more
gadget we need if we

675
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:01,260
want to get the
two color pattern.

676
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,760

677
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,890
This polygon maybe
is all one color.

678
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,760
Maybe it's all the
colored side of the paper.

679
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,989
But then at some point,
we might transition over

680
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:19,247
to another polygon, and
maybe that's the other color.

681
00:34:19,247 --> 00:34:21,330
So all we're going to do
is we're, again, visiting

682
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,790
these triangles in some order.

683
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:26,870
Whenever we go between a black
triangle and a white triangle,

684
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:30,130
we are going to apply
a color reversal

685
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:36,589
gadget, which is very simple.

686
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:41,780

687
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,489
I forgot to color one
side of the strip,

688
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:50,000
so bear with me for a second,
and feel free to color

689
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,750
in your own strip.

690
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:54,187

691
00:34:54,187 --> 00:34:56,159
Probably killing this
microphone right here.

692
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,340

693
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,570
Purple on one side,
white on the other,

694
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:05,990
although it's so transparent,
it looks almost the same.

695
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,460
The idea is very simple.

696
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,120
Where are we starting from?

697
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,470
We're starting from
the not purple side.

698
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,630
Then we make a mountain fold.

699
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,420
It's just like a turn gadget.

700
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,820
In fact, it's just like
you're turning 90 degrees.

701
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,900
We fold up like this, and
then we just immediately make

702
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,340
another 90 degree turn
without the first fold,

703
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:34,460
and we get a sharp transition
straight along the strip

704
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,630
from light purple to dark
purple, it looks like,

705
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:42,889
but from the white side
to the purple side.

706
00:35:42,889 --> 00:35:45,180
Right when you transition
between any pair of triangles

707
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,500
of the opposite color, you
just apply this gadget.

708
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,180
You make three more
folds, and boom,

709
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,787
you've got your color reversal.

710
00:35:51,787 --> 00:35:53,120
AUDIENCE: Can you do that again?

711
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,470
PROFESSOR: Do it again?

712
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:53,970
All right.

713
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,540
So first I make a mountain fold.

714
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,240

715
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,190
Now both sides are white.

716
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:05,180
Then I fold this guy up, so
now I have a regular 90 degree

717
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:08,507
turn, and then I
fold this guy back.

718
00:36:08,507 --> 00:36:11,090
That's the tricky part because
you can't see what's happening.

719
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,830
Let me flip it over for you.

720
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:19,580
So I'm just folding
the top two layers here

721
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:25,912
along that 45 degree angle,
and then I get that transition.

722
00:36:25,912 --> 00:36:27,620
On this side, it's
still purple and white

723
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,661
but it's a little uglier.

724
00:36:28,661 --> 00:36:31,220

725
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,100
It's on the slide.

726
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,220
You can try again.

727
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,600
It doesn't say here, but
fold just the back layers.

728
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:43,220

729
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,290
All right?

730
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,570
Questions?

731
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:49,770
So that's how you can
visit all these polygons,

732
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:53,650
do color transitions, you can do
it in 3D, make any polyhedron.

733
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:56,180
A little crazy, but
the point is you

734
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,310
do need to do some algorithmic
construction to really see

735
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,910
this method work.

736
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,132
You need those three gadgets.

737
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:03,840
You need to be sure
that you can actually

738
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,089
combine them in the right way.

739
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:08,180
And I'm hand waving a little
bit some of these details.

740
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,830
You should be more
careful, but it works.

741
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:14,450

742
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:17,112
It's obviously
horribly inefficient,

743
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:19,445
but we can make it at least
a little bit more efficient.

744
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,570
Let me tell you about that.

745
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:39,140

746
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:53,500
So we can achieve something I
call pseudo-efficiency, which

747
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:59,700
is if you are allowed to
start with any rectangle

748
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:09,580
you want, so in
particular, if we

749
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,650
start with a long strip of
paper like you did here,

750
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,440
then you can make
this super efficient.

751
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:23,080

752
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:29,760
The area of the piece of
paper that we start with

753
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:39,756
can be equal to the
surface area of the thing

754
00:38:39,756 --> 00:38:40,630
that we want to fold.

755
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:43,530

756
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,890
If we could achieve this,
we would be really happy.

757
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,340
That means we have zero wastage.

758
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,310
I can't get zero
wastage, but I can

759
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,705
get just a little
tiny bit of wastage.

760
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:54,780

761
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:59,790
So we write epsilon for a very
tiny result, very tiny error.

762
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,291
So epsilon does
have to be positive,

763
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:02,790
we have to have
some wastage, but it

764
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,010
can be arbitrarily small.

765
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:07,350
Basically, the narrower and
longer you make your strip,

766
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,100
the closer the area
of your piece of paper

767
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,280
gets to the surface area of your
target shape, which is the best

768
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,090
you can hope for.

769
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:17,130
So with this crazy proviso,
which is completely impractical

770
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:20,770
we get a super
practical outcome.

771
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,460
And the summation is
not very practical,

772
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,939
but it's kind of nifty,
and I particularly

773
00:39:24,939 --> 00:39:25,980
like the proof technique.

774
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:35,150
It uses a very powerful tool in
computational geometry, so let

775
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:35,900
me show it to you.

776
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:41,760

777
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,900
So the central issue is that
while visiting a triangle,

778
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,360
we actually do
pretty efficiently.

779
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,890
Except for the very
last strip, where

780
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:55,450
we might overlap ourselves,
except for these little corner

781
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,610
turn gadgets, and also
the material that's

782
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,907
used up in the
gadgets themselves,

783
00:39:59,907 --> 00:40:01,240
We're actually really efficient.

784
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,090
We're covering this
triangle almost one for one.

785
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,970
There's a little bit
of garbage at the edge

786
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,510
and a little bit of
garbage at this edge,

787
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:11,220
but you could imagine as
the strip gets smaller,

788
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,490
this wastage gets smaller,
because it's essentially

789
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:17,620
this length times the
width of the strip up

790
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,900
to constant factors.

791
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,310
So as the strip gets narrower,
it gets closer and closer

792
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:24,334
to this thing times
0, so this wastage

793
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:25,500
gets closer and closer to 0.

794
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,160
Same thing over here,
same thing over here.

795
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,790
The real problem
at this point is

796
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,960
that we visit some triangles
possibly many times.

797
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,710
I was totally free about
how I visited triangles.

798
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:40,190
Maybe I go here and then over
here and then back over here.

799
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,010
I may be very wasteful.

800
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,080
So I just want to
avoid that wastage.

801
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,295
Just visit each triangle
once, exactly once.

802
00:40:47,295 --> 00:40:50,380
How could you do
it exactly once?

803
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:54,180
With a great idea called
Hamiltonian refinement.

804
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,480

805
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,500
I've used this idea many times.

806
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,526
This was the first
time I used it.

807
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:03,830
It's very cool.

808
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,780
I think it goes back
to '97 or something.

809
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,865
So you have some triangulation.

810
00:41:09,865 --> 00:41:14,330

811
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:17,407
I'm going to keep it
relatively simple.

812
00:41:17,407 --> 00:41:19,740
And I'd really like to visit
each triangle exactly once.

813
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,156
So you think, OK,
maybe I'll start

814
00:41:21,156 --> 00:41:25,380
here, then I'll go over here,
and over here, and uh oh.

815
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,050
Then I'm stuck.

816
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,790
I can't get to the
other triangles

817
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:32,760
without revisiting
an existing triangle.

818
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,130
It's impossible to find what
we call a Hamiltonian path.

819
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:38,190
Hamiltonian path will visit
each triangle exactly once.

820
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,366
But who cares about
these triangles?

821
00:41:40,366 --> 00:41:42,240
I just made these
triangles to make it easier

822
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,670
to think about a polygon.

823
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,170
I could actually
cut these triangles

824
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:50,110
into smaller triangles and
ideally make it Hamiltonian.

825
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,440
So here's the idea.

826
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,350
There's this idea called the
dual graph, which is also

827
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:00,520
pretty central in
computational geometry,

828
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,680
where I'm going to make a
little dot for every triangle

829
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,110
inside each triangle,
and then I'm

830
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,220
going to connect
those dots whenever

831
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,930
there is two triangles
that share an edge.

832
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:15,120

833
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,460
This is called the dual graph.

834
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:21,880
These parts are called the dual
graph of the triangulation.

835
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,630
And in this picture,
I've got a nice, kind

836
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,380
of tree-shaped graph.

837
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,480
In general, you might
get cycles, but then

838
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,466
just throw away edges
until you get a tree.

839
00:42:29,466 --> 00:42:31,090
I really like to
think of it as a tree,

840
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,710
and if I throw in enough
edges, it will be a tree.

841
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:40,420
Then my idea is I'd really
like to just visit everything

842
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,350
in this order, walking
around the tree.

843
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:47,490

844
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,000
I can go around in
a cycle and visit

845
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,974
each of these little
polygons exactly once.

846
00:42:51,974 --> 00:42:53,515
Now, these polygons
aren't triangles,

847
00:42:53,515 --> 00:42:57,290
which is kind of annoying,
so I just triangulate.

848
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:03,020
So you could just triangulate
like this, I guess.

849
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:07,430
If you want to be
excessive and simpler,

850
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:09,820
from every one of
these dots, you

851
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,210
can cut to the midpoint
of the three edges

852
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:14,240
and also cut to the vertices.

853
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,590
For every triangle, I just
cut to the three vertices

854
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:19,820
and cut to the midpoints.

855
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:23,660
You do that, and
you are guaranteed.

856
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:27,120
This gets a little messy,
but this is theoretical.

857
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,090

858
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:33,660
You will increase the number of
triangles by a factor of six.

859
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:37,560
Each triangle gets replaced by
six little smaller triangles.

860
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,480
It covers the same region,
and yet now it's Hamiltonian.

861
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,270
Now I can visit these triangles
and visit each triangle exactly

862
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:46,510
once, and that's how you
get pseudo-efficiency.

863
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:49,731
Pretty easy once
you know this trick.

864
00:43:49,731 --> 00:43:50,230
Questions?

865
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:53,432

866
00:43:53,432 --> 00:43:55,340
AUDIENCE: Why is it
called pseudo-efficiency?

867
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,890
PROFESSOR: Well, I made that up.

868
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:58,920
Why is it called
pseudo-efficiency?

869
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,050
Because it's not
really efficient.

870
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:05,460
It is efficient,
I agree, but only

871
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,430
with this crazy
assumption that you're

872
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:09,930
allowed to start with an
arbitrarily narrow strip,

873
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:12,350
and that's not really practical.

874
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,110
The practical origami problem
is I start with a square.

875
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:19,570
How big of a square do I
need to fold this shape?

876
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:24,500
And that's something we'll
talk about probably next week.

877
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,820
That's been studied
but it's a lot harder,

878
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,615
so I'm starting
with the easy stuff.

879
00:44:29,615 --> 00:44:32,198
AUDIENCE: Does this necessarily
keep the mountains and valleys

880
00:44:32,198 --> 00:44:33,830
that you defined
at the beginning?

881
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:36,371
PROFESSOR: Will this keep the
mountains and valleys the same?

882
00:44:36,371 --> 00:44:38,462

883
00:44:38,462 --> 00:44:40,920
The input didn't specify where
the mountains valleys should

884
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,420
be.

885
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,870
It just said you have
to make these polygons.

886
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:49,180
Every fold you make in this
construction will stay,

887
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:52,404
but you may make more folds that
go on top of existing folds.

888
00:44:52,404 --> 00:44:54,820
I think all the mountains and
valleys that you define here

889
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:58,210
will remain mountains or valleys
as we specified, but keep

890
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:01,600
adding creases until you finish.

891
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,600
Yeah?

892
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,350
AUDIENCE: Are you
just doing a 2D case

893
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:08,834
of what we call the
3D pyramid there?

894
00:45:08,834 --> 00:45:09,333
[INAUDIBLE]

895
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:12,940

896
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,950
PROFESSOR: The question
is, what about 3D?

897
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:18,400
This dual graph idea
does work in 3D.

898
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,520
I drew a 2D picture because
it's a lot easier to draw,

899
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,567
but you could imagine, for
example, you have a cube.

900
00:45:25,567 --> 00:45:27,400
I'm not going to be
able to draw everything,

901
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,310
but you can still
form a dual graph.

902
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:32,865
I should have
triangulated the cube,

903
00:45:32,865 --> 00:45:34,990
but in fact, you can do
this for any kind of graph.

904
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:39,777
I'm making a dot for
every face of the thing

905
00:45:39,777 --> 00:45:40,610
that I want to make.

906
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,685
Each of these
polygons, I make a dot.

907
00:45:42,685 --> 00:45:45,040
So in fact, if I
finished this picture,

908
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:51,440
I would get the dual
graph is the octahedron.

909
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,130
It would look something
like this topologically.

910
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,440
It doesn't have to
be a geometric thing.

911
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,264
It works just as well in 3D.

912
00:45:59,264 --> 00:46:00,930
It actually still
works even if you just

913
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,400
say, for every
triangle, just cut

914
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,882
to the midpoints of the three
edges and to the vertices.

915
00:46:06,882 --> 00:46:08,340
Then that thing
will be Hamiltonian

916
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,880
and you can walk around
it by doing this dual

917
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,390
and spanning tree construction.

918
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:14,890
I won't go into it
exactly, but that

919
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:17,940
could be done in linear time.

920
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,940
I'm still only making a
two dimensional surface.

921
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,790
I'm not trying to
make a 3D solid here,

922
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:24,490
so that's why locally,
it's two dimensional.

923
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,560
Locally, this just works.

924
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,950
Another question?

925
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:33,102
AUDIENCE: So it seems that if
you could also just stick with

926
00:46:33,102 --> 00:46:36,704
the original construction,
and when you cannot find

927
00:46:36,704 --> 00:46:41,390
the Hamiltonian path around
the triangles, you just--

928
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:45,210
you don't cover them again, you
just get a narrow strip that

929
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:47,910
runs through them and just
reaches the corner you need?

930
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,160
PROFESSOR: That's a neat idea.

931
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,420
So instead of doing this
Hamiltonian refinement,

932
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,820
you could visit the
triangles in any order,

933
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,750
but then to get
from one triangle

934
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:57,910
to some distant
triangle, instead

935
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:00,760
of covering all the triangles in
the middle which you've already

936
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,400
covered, which is
excessive, just go

937
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,749
as straight there as possible.

938
00:47:07,749 --> 00:47:10,040
Locally, you'd think of that
as being a one dimensional

939
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,310
wastage instead of a
two dimensional wastage.

940
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:16,020
So probably you can get the
same result by that technique.

941
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,630
I hadn't thought of that before.

942
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:22,280
We should check it, but
I think that should work.

943
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,100
This is kind of cooler, just
because it uses a fancy tool,

944
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:28,004
but I imagine with a
little more analysis,

945
00:47:28,004 --> 00:47:29,795
you could prove that
that works because you

946
00:47:29,795 --> 00:47:31,336
know there aren't
too many triangles.

947
00:47:31,336 --> 00:47:33,920

948
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,420
Good.

949
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:37,570

950
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:39,870
I think I'm going to
skip seam placement

951
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:41,950
and move on to foldability.

952
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:44,340
This was a little intro
to origami design.

953
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,340
Obviously not practical
yet, but it's something.

954
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:51,076

955
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,075
It's nice and universal.

956
00:47:52,075 --> 00:47:53,125
You can make everything.

957
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:56,210

958
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:58,730
So let me tell you a little
bit about the other side

959
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:02,400
of the world, which is,
instead of a target shape,

960
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,080
what if I gave you
a crease pattern?

961
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:08,290
We just want to know, does
this crease pattern fold?

962
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:13,600
I give you the crease
pattern of that pinwheel.

963
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,380
I say, does this
fold into anything?

964
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,360
Does it fold into
a flat origami?

965
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,170
Does it fold into
something else?

966
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:21,200
Can you fold it
with simple folds?

967
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,040
Can you fold it
with origami folds?

968
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,060
Those are all
interesting questions.

969
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:30,790
We're going to start with a
very simple form of it, which

970
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:34,380
is when the piece of paper
is one dimensional, which

971
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,250
is almost what you
were thinking of here.

972
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,890
It's like strip folding, but
I'm going to furthermore require

973
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:43,090
that all the folds I make are
perpendicular to the strip

974
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,640
direction.

975
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:50,660
So I'm always going to fold
like this and then like this.

976
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,820
So it's going to remain a strip.

977
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,620
It'll just be a smaller strip.

978
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,800
I know it seems kind
of boring, but it's

979
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,470
something we
understand really well,

980
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:02,530
so that's why I'm going
to tell you about it.

981
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:04,930
And then it relates
to locally what

982
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:07,050
happens at one vertex
of the crease pattern,

983
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:11,750
but we'll get to
that next class.

984
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:15,790
So one dimensional flat folding.

985
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:17,500
I don't have them
anymore here, but I'm

986
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,800
going to redefine "piece of
paper" and all these things

987
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,230
because I want to
be even simpler.

988
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:26,330

989
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,981
So piece of paper now is going
to be a one dimensional line

990
00:49:29,981 --> 00:49:30,480
segment.

991
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,800

992
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:42,940
A crease is going to be
a point on that segment.

993
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:45,197
In general, a crease is
one dimension smaller

994
00:49:45,197 --> 00:49:47,030
than the piece of paper
you're working with.

995
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:48,220
You could actually
define "piece of paper"

996
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,570
to be a five dimensional
solid if you wanted.

997
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,630
Then creases would be
four dimensional flats,

998
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:54,320
they're called.

999
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,290
It's not a hyperplane.

1000
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:56,910
Four dimensional flat.

1001
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:00,160
That's what they're called.

1002
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,580
Or if you wanted to do curved
creases in five dimensions,

1003
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:06,992
then it's a four dimensional
surface somewhere in there.

1004
00:50:06,992 --> 00:50:11,170
We won't do 5D
origami in this class.

1005
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:15,480
Flat folding now means that
your folding lies on a line.

1006
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,230
Of course, it will
always lie in the plane

1007
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:20,952
if you're folding a line
segment in the plane.

1008
00:50:20,952 --> 00:50:23,160
So generally, we take a
piece of paper one dimension,

1009
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,100
we fold it in a space
that's one higher dimension,

1010
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,294
so we're going to be
folding this thing in 2D.

1011
00:50:28,294 --> 00:50:30,210
We use increases that
are one lower dimension.

1012
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:32,734
Here, zero dimensional points.

1013
00:50:32,734 --> 00:50:34,650
If we want it to be flat,
it should in the end

1014
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:36,691
lie in the same dimension
the piece of paper did.

1015
00:50:36,691 --> 00:50:39,560

1016
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,510
It's great because
I can just draw.

1017
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:43,080
There's my piece of paper.

1018
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,970
Here are some creases.

1019
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:47,370
They're spread out however.

1020
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:49,390
Maybe they're marked
mountain and valley,

1021
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:52,580
and I'm not going to use
dashes and dot dashes here

1022
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,570
because they're
points, so I'll write

1023
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:57,460
M's and V's,
something like that.

1024
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,410
And I didn't check,
but this either

1025
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:01,125
will be flat foldable or not.

1026
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:06,440

1027
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,180
I think it is.

1028
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,460
How do I know that it is?

1029
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,930
Because we have a great
characterization that tells you

1030
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:15,789
when a mountain valley
pattern is flat foldable.

1031
00:51:15,789 --> 00:51:17,330
Now, the first
question you might ask

1032
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:19,900
is, what about
crease patterns if I

1033
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,480
don't specify
mountains and valleys?

1034
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,110
Then you can always
fold anything.

1035
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:28,220
If I just gave you a
segment and I put creases

1036
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:33,670
in some crazy pattern, all
I do is alternate mountain,

1037
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:36,610
valley, mountain, valley,
mountain, valley, mountain,

1038
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:40,410
valley, and I'm going to regret
making such a big example.

1039
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:47,300
And I just go mountain, valley,
mountain-- it alternates.

1040
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,950
You get some zigzag.

1041
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:51,800
And this thing is not going
to collide with itself.

1042
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,910
It just works.

1043
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:55,240
In fact, you could even fold
it one step at a time left

1044
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,640
to right by simple
folds, and you'll

1045
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,389
get a nice flat
folding of that thing.

1046
00:52:00,389 --> 00:52:01,930
So every crease
pattern can be folded

1047
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:04,340
with some mountain-valley
assignment, namely

1048
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:08,060
the alternating accordion
pleat, but what if I give you

1049
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:11,420
the mountain-valley assignment?

1050
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:16,000
Sometimes I can do
it, sometimes I can't.

1051
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:22,760
So here's an example where
you can't, two valleys

1052
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,660
with some really big
segments on either side.

1053
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:29,030
So when you try to fold that,
it looks something like that,

1054
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:31,200
and if one of these was
really short, one of them

1055
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,110
could tuck inside the other,
but because they're both long,

1056
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:36,157
they have to collide.

1057
00:52:36,157 --> 00:52:37,990
That's the sort of thing
we're worried about

1058
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:40,448
and we'd like to detect that
efficiently with an algorithm.

1059
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:55,010

1060
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:56,520
So let me tell you how.

1061
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:08,340
We're going to use two
different operations,

1062
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:10,260
and both of these
operations will, in fact,

1063
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:14,500
be performable
using simple folds.

1064
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,000
What we're going
to end up proving

1065
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,660
is that a one dimensional
mountain valley

1066
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,820
pattern is flat foldable
if and only if it's flat

1067
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:24,560
foldable via a sequence
of simple folds.

1068
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,990
So these simple folds that
we've been arguing about

1069
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:31,610
are universally
powerful for 1D paper.

1070
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:33,700
They are not universally
powerful for 2D paper

1071
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,120
because you cannot fold this
pinwheel with simple folds.

1072
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,180
There's no first fold to make.

1073
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:42,180
But in one dimension,
turns out there is.

1074
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:46,550
It's not obvious, but it's true.

1075
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:49,980
And here, we're going to
make two very simple kinds

1076
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,570
of simple folds.

1077
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:54,150
The first one is called
an end fold, which

1078
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:58,650
is you take the last, or
the very first crease,

1079
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:02,990
and you just fold it over.

1080
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:03,910
That's an end fold.

1081
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:09,040
Now, for this to be valid
in the simple folding world,

1082
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,440
to not get stuck,
I'm going to require

1083
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:19,600
that this portion has
no creases inside it.

1084
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,860
So it could have a crease
right at the boundary,

1085
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:25,160
but there are no
creases in that region.

1086
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,230
So when I fold this thing over,
I don't cover anything up.

1087
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:31,170
No creases get covered up.

1088
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:34,340
This in some sense is
clearly a good thing to do.

1089
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,569
This may not exist.

1090
00:54:35,569 --> 00:54:37,610
If you find such a crease
and you make this fold,

1091
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:39,450
now you can think of
this piece of paper

1092
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:40,830
as sort of glued up there.

1093
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:44,180
You can think of just you cut
off one part of the paper.

1094
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:47,040
You made a problem even easier.

1095
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,205
So this is clearly
a safe thing to do.

1096
00:54:49,205 --> 00:54:51,040
It should make your
folding easier,

1097
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,080
but usually it doesn't exist.

1098
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,650
In that case, we
make what's called

1099
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:59,770
a crimp, which is
we have our segment.

1100
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:03,390
We take two creases with
different mountain-valley

1101
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:03,910
assignments.

1102
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:06,076
Maybe the first one's
mountain, second one's valley,

1103
00:55:06,076 --> 00:55:09,390
but they're different, and
then we fold those two creases.

1104
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:12,390

1105
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:13,680
Something like that.

1106
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,556
So the paper get smaller
again, but here it's

1107
00:55:15,556 --> 00:55:17,846
a little less clear what's
happening because there were

1108
00:55:17,846 --> 00:55:19,550
creases over here,
creases over here.

1109
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:20,890
They got closer to each other.

1110
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:22,170
Maybe that's a problem.

1111
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:23,140
Maybe it messes you up.

1112
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:24,015
Turns out it doesn't.

1113
00:55:24,015 --> 00:55:26,810

1114
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:31,260
The other thing, again, we
require, if this is distance x,

1115
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:36,250
we require that this region
of length x and this region

1116
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,884
of length x is empty of creases.

1117
00:55:37,884 --> 00:55:38,800
There's nothing there.

1118
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,780
You could have things
on the boundary

1119
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,370
but nothing interior to here,
nothing interior to here,

1120
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:45,250
and nothing interior to here.

1121
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:47,960
Just two increases with sort
of a nice, safe neighborhood

1122
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,180
around them so that
when I make these two

1123
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:54,050
folds, this whole region,
I didn't cover anything up

1124
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:54,550
in there.

1125
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:56,750
There's nothing in
this Zorro mark.

1126
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:59,870

1127
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:02,180
That's the definition of
an end fold and a crimp.

1128
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,570
Now, maybe these
things don't exist.

1129
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:07,360
I claim if they don't exist,
you are not flat foldable

1130
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,760
no matter what you do.

1131
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,580
These are enough
to make everything

1132
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:11,550
that is flat foldable.

1133
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:14,672

1134
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:15,755
We're going to prove that.

1135
00:56:15,755 --> 00:56:37,210

1136
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:43,370
We're going to characterize
flat foldability by saying,

1137
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:48,489
if I gave you some
mountain-valley pattern,

1138
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:50,155
and I want to know,
is it flat foldable?

1139
00:56:50,155 --> 00:56:53,490

1140
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:55,030
Remember, a
mountain-valley pattern

1141
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:58,580
is a crease pattern together
with M's and V's written

1142
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,710
on each crease.

1143
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:03,420
I claim it is flat
foldable if and only

1144
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:18,820
if there is a sequence
of crimps and end folds.

1145
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:23,799

1146
00:57:23,799 --> 00:57:26,340
So this is saying that crimps
and end folds are all you need.

1147
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:29,620
In fact, we're going to show
that you can make any crimp

1148
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:31,600
and any end fold,
anything that looks valid,

1149
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,720
anything that has these
empty regions here,

1150
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,980
just greedily keep doing
one after the other

1151
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:40,480
without regard to what's
going to happen in the future.

1152
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,350
If you get stuck, then your
thing in the first place

1153
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:44,312
was not flat foldable.

1154
00:57:44,312 --> 00:57:46,270
If you finish, obviously,
it was flat foldable.

1155
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:47,720
You've folded it.

1156
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,770
So it doesn't matter even what
order you do these operations.

1157
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:53,890
I won't write that here,
but we will prove that.

1158
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:56,100
And there's another
characterization

1159
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,660
which we use to prove this one.

1160
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:00,250
This is the one we care about.

1161
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:04,420
This one's a little bit
easier to think about.

1162
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,200
I call it the mingling property.

1163
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,180
It says mountains and valleys
hang out with each other,

1164
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:09,680
basically.

1165
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:14,291

1166
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:15,540
That's why I call it mingling.

1167
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:19,380

1168
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:20,710
So what does it mean?

1169
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:32,210

1170
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:35,490
If I take a whole
bunch of V's in a row,

1171
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:41,694
or I take a whole bunch M's
in a row, as many as I can,

1172
00:58:41,694 --> 00:58:44,110
that means they're surrounded
by creases of the other type

1173
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:46,637
or possibly the
edge of the paper.

1174
00:58:46,637 --> 00:58:48,970
But if I take a whole bunch
of V's, then the next crease

1175
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:52,810
and the previous crease
are M's, let's say,

1176
00:58:52,810 --> 00:59:02,670
then the adjacent crease
of the other type,

1177
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:07,930
or possibly the
end of the paper,

1178
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:13,970
and I want this to be
true on at least one side.

1179
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:15,720
This is, again, one
of those things that's

1180
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,650
much easier in a picture, but
I will write down the words

1181
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:21,030
first.

1182
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:38,410
Is nearer than the adjacent
M or V. Sorry, backwards.

1183
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:42,060
I'm trying to use
parallel construction here

1184
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:45,991
but I got it inverted
for my notes.

1185
00:59:45,991 --> 00:59:46,990
Let me draw the picture.

1186
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:51,020
You have a segment.

1187
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:55,490
Suppose I take some maximal
sequence of M's all in a row.

1188
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:58,250

1189
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:00,934
So maybe on one side,
maybe the next thing

1190
01:00:00,934 --> 01:00:02,350
here is just the
edge of the paper

1191
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:03,474
so there's no crease there.

1192
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:07,150

1193
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:10,770
If this was it, then I
would say this thing is not

1194
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:14,430
mingling because this
distance is bigger

1195
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:17,880
than this one and this distance
is bigger than this one.

1196
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,710
So these M's are really
clustered together.

1197
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:22,492
They're not mingling with
the edges, so that's bad.

1198
01:00:22,492 --> 01:00:23,950
And in fact, this
thing is not flat

1199
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:26,360
foldable for the same
reason that one is not.

1200
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:30,310
But if, for example, I put
a valley crease right here,

1201
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:32,840
then this is closer than that.

1202
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,010
I mean this distance is
smaller than that one.

1203
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:37,670
So I call that mingling because
at least on the right side,

1204
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:39,130
the M's are mingling
with the V's.

1205
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:41,060
On the left side,
they're not mingling,

1206
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:42,900
but right side's
better than nothing.

1207
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,990
I need this to hold
on at least one side.

1208
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:46,880
Could hold on both.

1209
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:51,905
I claim this thing
is flat foldable.

1210
01:00:51,905 --> 01:00:54,560
Is that true?

1211
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,990
Yeah.

1212
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:58,150
Maybe.

1213
01:00:58,150 --> 01:00:59,150
It doesn't look so true.

1214
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:08,567

1215
01:01:08,567 --> 01:01:10,775
I think I probably need some
condition on the V also.

1216
01:01:10,775 --> 01:01:16,750

1217
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:18,540
Well, we'll see what
happens in the proof.

1218
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,005
That's more exciting.

1219
01:01:20,005 --> 01:01:21,880
Usually the proof is
easier than the example.

1220
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:37,000

1221
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:37,730
Oh, I see why.

1222
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:43,640

1223
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:44,630
There's a problem here.

1224
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:48,762
I think I need to say "forever."

1225
01:01:48,762 --> 01:01:50,220
I'll say what I
mean by that later.

1226
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:54,040

1227
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,720
The proof will still
work, but it's not

1228
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:56,678
such a pretty property.

1229
01:01:56,678 --> 01:02:04,870

1230
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:09,590
The proof is in three
parts, basically.

1231
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:19,380
First part is if
you're flat foldable,

1232
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,095
then you are mingling.

1233
01:02:21,095 --> 01:02:26,240

1234
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,240
Certainly, if I want these
all to be equivalent,

1235
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,777
it should be true that the
first one implies the third one.

1236
01:02:31,777 --> 01:02:33,360
This is actually
really easy to prove.

1237
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:38,820

1238
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:40,800
Suppose it were not mingling.

1239
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,610
Suppose I had some
crease pattern that

1240
01:02:42,610 --> 01:02:43,690
violates that constraint.

1241
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:46,100
What that means is I
have a bunch of M's here,

1242
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,960
I don't know how
they're spread out.

1243
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,700
Then I know that
there's a big gap

1244
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:55,086
until the next crease,
something like that.

1245
01:02:55,086 --> 01:02:56,960
Well, let's think about--
there aren't really

1246
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,780
that many ways to fold
a whole bunch of M's

1247
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:01,730
in a row or a whole bunch
of V's that's symmetric.

1248
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:04,257
You pretty much have
to spiral around.

1249
01:03:04,257 --> 01:03:05,965
You're always turning
the same direction.

1250
01:03:05,965 --> 01:03:10,960

1251
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,452
If it's flat foldable, which
is what we're assuming here,

1252
01:03:13,452 --> 01:03:14,910
it's got to look
kind of like that.

1253
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:16,826
In fact, it has two ends,
so it could actually

1254
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:18,970
make two spirals.

1255
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:21,190
But if you think about
what happens there,

1256
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:28,380
this last part at the end of the
spirals, that's this segment.

1257
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:32,480
That's when you possibly turn
around the other direction.

1258
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,190
Maybe this is the valley.

1259
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:35,860
But take a look at
what's going on here.

1260
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:39,150
This segment is tucked
inside the spiral.

1261
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:40,720
If it's super long
like it is here,

1262
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,170
if it's longer than the previous
portion-- let me label this.

1263
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:52,750
This is x, this is x,
this is y, this is y.

1264
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:54,300
That looks really bad.

1265
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,634
x has to be smaller than y.

1266
01:03:55,634 --> 01:03:57,300
Otherwise, it's going
to penetrate right

1267
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,710
through that corner.

1268
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:04,810
In this case with the double
spiral, double spiral all

1269
01:04:04,810 --> 01:04:07,250
the way, what does it mean?

1270
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:09,860

1271
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:12,250
I guess no one knows
double rainbow.

1272
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:15,810

1273
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,770
Bad stuff.

1274
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:20,310
In the double spiral
case, in fact, this end

1275
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:22,180
must be shorter than
this one and this one

1276
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:24,000
must be shorter than this one.

1277
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,820
So in this case, you must
be mingling on both sides,

1278
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:28,930
but it doesn't have
to be that way.

1279
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:31,540
If it's just a single
spiral, this last segment

1280
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:32,540
can be really long.

1281
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:33,180
That's OK.

1282
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:36,450
It's much longer than this
one, but the inner part

1283
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:39,010
of the spiral must
always be smaller

1284
01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:41,040
than the next segment
of the spiral,

1285
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,710
and that's exactly
what mingling says.

1286
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:45,290
Could be on the left, could be
on the right, you don't know.

1287
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:47,620
But on at least one of the
sides, you must be mingling.

1288
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:50,290
And therefore, if you're going
to have a flat folding at all,

1289
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:51,930
you must be mingling.

1290
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:52,620
Clear?

1291
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:53,140
Question?

1292
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,990
AUDIENCE: When you say a maximal
sequence, what do you mean?

1293
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:57,440
PROFESSOR: Maximal
means that you

1294
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,490
can't make it any
bigger locally.

1295
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:01,590
I can't add any more
creases and still

1296
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:03,500
have a contiguous
bunch of mountains.

1297
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,140
It's a good question.

1298
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:08,340
In mathematics, there's
maximal and maximum.

1299
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:11,900
Maximal means locally biggest,
maximum means globally biggest.

1300
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:14,040
So I don't mean take
the biggest sequence

1301
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,900
of contiguous M's you can find.

1302
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,620
I just mean take some contiguous
sequence of M's that you

1303
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:22,290
can't make any bigger
on either side.

1304
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:24,570
I just mean that it's
surrounded by valleys.

1305
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:31,030
I want this to hold for every
contiguous sequence of M's.

1306
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:33,780
That's one of those funny
math technical terms.

1307
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:36,470
Other questions?

1308
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:38,040
So that's the first thing.

1309
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,705
Somehow I want to connect all
these properties together.

1310
01:05:40,705 --> 01:05:44,390

1311
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:53,280
The next part is that
if you're mingling,

1312
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,770
either there's an end
fold or there's a crimp.

1313
01:05:55,770 --> 01:06:02,450

1314
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:05,660
At least one of those two
things must be possible.

1315
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:07,970
So this would be good
news because if I'm

1316
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:09,820
flat foldable,
then I'm mingling.

1317
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:12,250
If I'm mingling, then
there's a fold I can make.

1318
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:13,389
That seems like progress.

1319
01:06:13,389 --> 01:06:15,430
Then I have to show that
I don't mess anything up

1320
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:18,270
when I make that fold.

1321
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:20,719
But if I could keep going
in a circle like this,

1322
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:22,510
then I would keep being
able to make folds,

1323
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:24,170
and then eventually I
would fold the whole thing

1324
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:25,940
because there's only
end folds at the end.

1325
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,140
I'll have made them all.

1326
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:32,770

1327
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:36,215
It's not that much
trickier, I guess.

1328
01:06:36,215 --> 01:06:39,175
It involves parentheses.

1329
01:06:39,175 --> 01:06:40,300
That's one way to write it.

1330
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:40,925
Yeah, question?

1331
01:06:40,925 --> 01:06:44,340

1332
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:46,790
AUDIENCE: So right now,
the mingling property

1333
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:53,250
is finding a way that [INAUDIBLE]
sequence two or more?

1334
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:54,344
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1335
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,864
AUDIENCE: And there is an
example that doesn't...

1336
01:06:56,864 --> 01:06:57,530
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1337
01:06:57,530 --> 01:06:59,100
Just ignore this.

1338
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:02,140
It'll be easier to
think of it that way.

1339
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:04,670
I'm going to use mingling
to prove this property,

1340
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:07,740
but this is not equivalent
to those properties.

1341
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:10,700
You need to add
"forever," but that's

1342
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:12,515
too confusing at the moment.

1343
01:07:12,515 --> 01:07:13,890
This is a definition
of mingling.

1344
01:07:13,890 --> 01:07:16,789
We're going to use it
as a separate thing,

1345
01:07:16,789 --> 01:07:19,080
and I'm going to prove these
two things are equivalent.

1346
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,680
Then I'll be correct.

1347
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:24,040
Correct is always a good thing.

1348
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:32,220
So what I want to do is for each
of these mingling sequences,

1349
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:41,820
for each maximal
sequence of M's or V's, I

1350
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:45,340
want to write down two symbols.

1351
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:49,670
I'm going to write a curved
left parenthesis if it

1352
01:07:49,670 --> 01:08:00,020
is left mingling, meaning I have
all these mountains, let's say.

1353
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:04,340

1354
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:05,940
Draw it in a reasonable way.

1355
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:08,860
Then I'm happy on the left side.

1356
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:13,637
I'm mingling with a V with
an M fold on the left side.

1357
01:08:13,637 --> 01:08:15,970
I know it's either left
mingling or it's right mingling.

1358
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:18,260
I'm assuming mingling here.

1359
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:21,790
I will write a square
bracket if it's not.

1360
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:24,819
Then I will write a
curved right bracket

1361
01:08:24,819 --> 01:08:31,200
if you're right
mingling, which is just

1362
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,700
the same picture but
on the other side.

1363
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:36,660
And I'm going to write a closed
square bracket if it's not.

1364
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:40,450

1365
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:45,283
Then I claim that
parentheses sequence

1366
01:08:45,283 --> 01:08:46,324
has some nice properties.

1367
01:08:46,324 --> 01:08:53,760

1368
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:57,660
So for example, this
is a string that I get.

1369
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:02,779
It might look like
this, maybe that.

1370
01:09:02,779 --> 01:09:03,620
Who knows?

1371
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:04,720
It looks like something.

1372
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:08,214
I know that every pair, at least
one of the two sides is curved.

1373
01:09:08,214 --> 01:09:10,380
I can't have them both be
square because then you're

1374
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,600
not mingling at all.

1375
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,950
I know I'm always mingling
left or mingling right,

1376
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:15,290
so it's something.

1377
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:17,410
Now, one thing
that's really good

1378
01:09:17,410 --> 01:09:22,529
is I have no double
square bracket.

1379
01:09:22,529 --> 01:09:24,290
That's impossible.

1380
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:27,300
I also know that
if I had something

1381
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:29,979
like this, what does that mean?

1382
01:09:29,979 --> 01:09:37,500
It means I have a bunch
of mountains over here,

1383
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,779
then I have a very
nearby valley, and then

1384
01:09:40,779 --> 01:09:44,760
a bunch of valleys
over here, and I

1385
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:48,100
know that the mountains
are right mingling, which

1386
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:55,350
means I know that
x is bigger than y.

1387
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:56,600
That's what this symbol means.

1388
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,310
It means to the right of the
M's, I've got a small gap,

1389
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:02,080
and it means to the left of the
V's, I also have a small gap.

1390
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:05,825
That means y is also bigger
than this z distance.

1391
01:10:05,825 --> 01:10:08,690

1392
01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:09,440
AUDIENCE: Smaller.

1393
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,370
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

1394
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:13,020

1395
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:14,416
Smaller.

1396
01:10:14,416 --> 01:10:18,090
I'm too tempted to
combine them together,

1397
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:21,630
but it's a funny looking thing.
y is smaller than both x and z.

1398
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:24,630
So then what do I do?

1399
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:25,130
Crimp.

1400
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:29,510

1401
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:32,120
That was sort of the
definition of a crimp,

1402
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:35,320
that at least if I took
this region x and copied it

1403
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,080
over here, those were
empty of creases.

1404
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:40,920
And now we're saying that
there's a big gap here.

1405
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,420
I guess technically
it's bigger than

1406
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:45,030
or equal to if you said
all these things right.

1407
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:49,320

1408
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:53,560
I said "nearer," but I
meant non-strictly nearer.

1409
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:57,210
It's enough to do a crimp.

1410
01:10:57,210 --> 01:10:59,440
So if I find this, I'm happy.

1411
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,420
The other thing that
I'm really happy with

1412
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:09,205
is if I have an open
paren at the beginning,

1413
01:11:09,205 --> 01:11:12,640
a curved parenthesis,
open parenthesis,

1414
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,020
at the beginning of the
string, or a right parenthesis

1415
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:18,640
at the end of the
string, because that

1416
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,060
means I can do an end fold.

1417
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:25,560

1418
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,580
That means that you have
a very short segment

1419
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:29,730
at the very beginning so
you can just fold it over.

1420
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:31,688
This means you have a
short segment at the end.

1421
01:11:31,688 --> 01:11:33,700
Just fold it over.

1422
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:36,270
So as long as I can find
one of these three things,

1423
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:37,610
I am golden.

1424
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:42,870
I have what I want, which
was an end fold or a crimp.

1425
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:45,890
How do I prove that I
have one of those things?

1426
01:11:45,890 --> 01:11:47,490
The easy way is
by contradiction.

1427
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:50,380
Just imagine if you didn't
have any one of these things,

1428
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:52,900
it's pretty forced what you
have to have in your string

1429
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:55,880
because you know you must start
with an open square bracket.

1430
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:58,380
You also know that you cannot
then immediately have a closed

1431
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:02,707
square bracket, so you
must have a closed paren.

1432
01:12:02,707 --> 01:12:05,040
Now I know that I cannot have
an open paren because then

1433
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,210
I'd have this, and that
would be good for me.

1434
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:09,860
So if I want to be bad, I have
to have an open square bracket,

1435
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,568
but then I'd have to
have a closed paren,

1436
01:12:11,568 --> 01:12:14,100
and then I'd have to have an
open square bracket, and so on.

1437
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:17,600
In the end, you will have
a closed paren at the end,

1438
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,570
and that means you
can make an end fold.

1439
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:22,340
So either something
failed in here.

1440
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:24,780
Maybe I had two parens
together-- then I

1441
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:26,490
would have gotten
a crimp-- or I can

1442
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:28,270
keep going all the
way through here

1443
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:29,700
and get a closed
paren at the end.

1444
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:32,180
In any case, I get at least
one of these three things

1445
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:34,940
happening, and so I get
either an end fold or a crimp

1446
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:36,477
assuming I am mingling.

1447
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:38,060
And instead of
assuming I am mingling,

1448
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:40,300
I can just assume that
I'm flat foldable,

1449
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,305
and then I get from this
chain of implications

1450
01:12:42,305 --> 01:12:45,455
that there is an
end fold or a crimp.

1451
01:12:45,455 --> 01:12:46,500
OK so far?

1452
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,950
So that means I can
make at least one fold.

1453
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:51,570
If I am flat foldable, I can
make at least one crimp or end

1454
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:52,740
fold.

1455
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:55,611
Now the question is,
can I keep going?

1456
01:12:55,611 --> 01:12:57,110
For that, we need
one more property.

1457
01:12:57,110 --> 01:13:14,810

1458
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:17,370
If I make a crimp
or an end fold,

1459
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:21,180
I want to prove that that
preserves flat foldability.

1460
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:32,105

1461
01:13:32,105 --> 01:13:34,230
What that means is if I
start with something that's

1462
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:36,438
flat foldable and then I
make a crimp or an end fold,

1463
01:13:36,438 --> 01:13:37,800
I will still be flat foldable.

1464
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,500
This is the property
I need because it

1465
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,280
will let me close the chain.

1466
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,030
I'm flat foldable,
therefore I'm mingling,

1467
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:45,880
therefore I have an end fold
or a crimp, so I make it.

1468
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:48,130
This property says that I
will still be flat foldable,

1469
01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:49,588
therefore number
one applies again.

1470
01:13:49,588 --> 01:13:52,060
I'm still mingling, I
can still find a fold,

1471
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:54,861
and I'm still flat foldable,
so I'm still mingling.

1472
01:13:54,861 --> 01:13:55,860
I can still find a fold.

1473
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:56,704
I can keep going.

1474
01:13:56,704 --> 01:13:58,120
I will never get
stuck because I'm

1475
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,050
guaranteed if I
started flat foldable,

1476
01:14:00,050 --> 01:14:02,880
I will be flat foldable forever.

1477
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,375
I will also be mingling forever.

1478
01:14:04,375 --> 01:14:06,980

1479
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:09,170
I realize now but
apparently have not

1480
01:14:09,170 --> 01:14:11,752
realized before, it's not
enough to be mingling just

1481
01:14:11,752 --> 01:14:12,460
at the beginning.

1482
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:14,850
You have to be mingling
through every step there.

1483
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:16,180
In fact, what we're
showing is that you're

1484
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:18,340
fat foldable at every step,
which implies mingling,

1485
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:19,714
but mingling is
not quite enough.

1486
01:14:19,714 --> 01:14:23,120
You'd have to check it
all the way through.

1487
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,850
That's why I stated
the theorem wrong.

1488
01:14:25,850 --> 01:14:29,970
How do we prove this
theorem, this claim?

1489
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:32,010
I'm going to do it
proof by picture.

1490
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:35,140
It's not always OK,
but it will be OK.

1491
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:35,730
Trust me.

1492
01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:38,129

1493
01:14:38,129 --> 01:14:39,795
We are assuming that
we're flat foldable

1494
01:14:39,795 --> 01:14:41,960
and we're assuming there's
a crimp or an end fold.

1495
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:43,446
Actually, we know
that that exists.

1496
01:14:43,446 --> 01:14:45,070
I'm going to think
about the crimp case

1497
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:47,280
because end fold
is even simpler.

1498
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,200

1499
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,610
See, here's the thing.

1500
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:56,440
I would really like to fold
some crimp like this, let's say.

1501
01:14:56,440 --> 01:15:01,380
This is an M, this
is a V. What I'm

1502
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:03,920
claiming is I'm allowed
to make that crimp first

1503
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,950
and then do everything else,
but conceivably, there's

1504
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:09,790
some flat folding that
doesn't make this crimp first.

1505
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:11,330
I mean, it must
fold this mountain

1506
01:15:11,330 --> 01:15:13,330
and it must fold this
valley, but at some point.

1507
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:14,880
We don't really know when.

1508
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,890
Somehow it all
simultaneously collapses

1509
01:15:16,890 --> 01:15:18,349
into some flat folding.

1510
01:15:18,349 --> 01:15:19,640
Now, this thing should be flat.

1511
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,670
It should line in a line.

1512
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:22,336
I'm stretching it out
so you can see it.

1513
01:15:22,336 --> 01:15:24,840

1514
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:27,240
It's a segment
that we're folding,

1515
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:30,130
so maybe it does this,
some crazy thing.

1516
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:34,380
Maybe this part does
something crazy here,

1517
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:36,240
goes there, whatever.

1518
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:39,820
We know it's not crossing
and it's sort of horizontal,

1519
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:41,690
but it could be an ugly mess.

1520
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:43,690
And in particular,
in this picture,

1521
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:47,360
it does not look like this crimp
was done first-- maybe embolden

1522
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:51,470
the crimp here-- because there's
this stuff in the middle.

1523
01:15:51,470 --> 01:15:53,490
Now, we know that there's
no creases in here.

1524
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:58,840
We know the earliest we can turn
is at the ends of the crimp.

1525
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:01,740
But there could be stuff that
comes in the middle here.

1526
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:02,860
What do I do?

1527
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:06,930
I just move the
stuff out of the way.

1528
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:08,410
Let me do this the right way.

1529
01:16:08,410 --> 01:16:10,810
Got to do this a
little bit carefully,

1530
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:13,269
and unfortunately, my
picture is so messy,

1531
01:16:13,269 --> 01:16:14,310
hopefully you can see it.

1532
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:18,350
So I'm going to take this part,
which is inside the crimp,

1533
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:22,570
I'm going to move
it down here, just

1534
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:25,970
lower those layers down to here.

1535
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:30,490
Now I know locally,
there's a fold right here.

1536
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:32,830
And so if I take all
the stuff that's in here

1537
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:36,220
and move it down here, it
will still be non-crossing.

1538
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:42,050
And then I take this stuff
and I move it up here.

1539
01:16:42,050 --> 01:16:44,517
Equivalently, you can
think of me crushing this

1540
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:46,350
down and crushing this
up, but it's actually

1541
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:48,190
important the direction
these things go.

1542
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:51,110
I could not put this stuff up
here because I don't really

1543
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:52,410
know how long this goes.

1544
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:54,609
It's not valid for me
to try to put it up.

1545
01:16:54,609 --> 01:16:55,900
I could collide with something.

1546
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:57,830
But I know that there's
a crease right here,

1547
01:16:57,830 --> 01:16:59,439
so I can put it right over here.

1548
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:01,480
I can take this stuff and
put it right over here.

1549
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:03,688
This is a weird kind of
manipulation of folded states

1550
01:17:03,688 --> 01:17:06,390
which we don't normally do,
but here we need to do it.

1551
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:08,840
After I've done that--
is there any hope

1552
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,490
of me redrawing the picture?

1553
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:13,000
Maybe.

1554
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,450
After we've done that,
we'll have the crimp.

1555
01:17:15,450 --> 01:17:18,430
It will be nice and tight.

1556
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:26,520
And then we'll have
this finger here,

1557
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:32,140
and then it goes up
here, up this anvil.

1558
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:36,250
Then this part, instead
of going inside,

1559
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:46,130
actually goes in here, up
there, something like that,

1560
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:47,510
and that's the end.

1561
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:49,410
Then this is the other side.

1562
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:52,230
Other side wasn't too
complicated, I think.

1563
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:54,450
But you can check.

1564
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:56,870
I guess now it's down here.

1565
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:58,970
But you can really just
do the shifting locally

1566
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:00,400
and it doesn't mess anything up.

1567
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,250
I'm going to wave my
hands because it's

1568
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:04,110
a bit messy to
really prove that.

1569
01:18:04,110 --> 01:18:06,570
But if you do that, boom.

1570
01:18:06,570 --> 01:18:10,074
Now this crimp looks like
it was actually done first.

1571
01:18:10,074 --> 01:18:11,740
You can see that this
folded state could

1572
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:14,480
have been made by first doing
that crimp and then folding

1573
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,970
the rest.

1574
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:19,660
You can treat this as if the
paper was fused together here,

1575
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:22,441
and that will be a folded state
of that smaller piece of paper.

1576
01:18:22,441 --> 01:18:24,940
So even though we were shifting
creases closer to each other

1577
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:27,029
and it looked a little
scary what's happening,

1578
01:18:27,029 --> 01:18:28,570
we know from this
construction if you

1579
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:31,160
could fold the original thing,
you can fold the thing even

1580
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,890
when the crimp got
fused together.

1581
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:34,690
Therefore, crimps
are always safe,

1582
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:37,810
and by an even easier argument,
end folds are always safe.

1583
01:18:37,810 --> 01:18:40,810
I already gave that
argument, basically.

1584
01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:43,570
So a little crazy,
but that proves

1585
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:45,610
that you preserve
flat foldability

1586
01:18:45,610 --> 01:18:50,430
by going in this chain
n or n/2 times,

1587
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:53,100
you will fold everything if you
were originally flat foldable.

1588
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,433
If you're not, you will get
stuck because otherwise, you

1589
01:18:55,433 --> 01:18:57,570
would find a folding, and so on.

1590
01:18:57,570 --> 01:18:58,070
Clear?

1591
01:18:58,070 --> 01:19:03,130

1592
01:19:03,130 --> 01:19:05,910
I'll just mention
you can generalize

1593
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:11,660
this to folding two dimensional
maps with simple folds.

1594
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:15,880
I should say, of course, an
end fold is a simple fold.

1595
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:18,067
A crimp is two simple folds.

1596
01:19:18,067 --> 01:19:19,650
You can first fold
along the mountain,

1597
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:22,233
you won't get any collision, and
then fold back on the valley.

1598
01:19:22,233 --> 01:19:24,020
That's a simple fold.

1599
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:26,020
So this is saying,
in fact, something

1600
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:28,380
is flat foldable
in one dimension if

1601
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:32,045
and only if it is flat foldable
by a sequence of simple folds.

1602
01:19:32,045 --> 01:19:33,920
As long as you stick to
crimps and end folds,

1603
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:35,920
it doesn't matter what
order you do them in.

1604
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,610

1605
01:19:38,610 --> 01:19:41,840
That's not true as soon as
you go to two dimensions.

1606
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:55,080
So for example, just
for fun, do I really

1607
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:56,320
want to draw the whole thing?

1608
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:57,278
I guess I've committed.

1609
01:19:57,278 --> 01:20:02,237

1610
01:20:02,237 --> 01:20:03,820
There's a couple
examples in the notes

1611
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:07,420
that you can take a look at,
and I encourage you to make one.

1612
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:10,826
This can be folded flat
but not by simple folds,

1613
01:20:10,826 --> 01:20:13,200
and you can see that it can't
be followed by simple folds

1614
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,700
because there's no fold that
goes all the way through.

1615
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:17,950
This line is valley,
mountain, mountain.

1616
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:21,480
There's no line that's all
mountains or all valleys.

1617
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:25,310
But you can use this structure
to understand at least which

1618
01:20:25,310 --> 01:20:28,530
rectangular maps with
horizontal and vertical creases

1619
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:30,730
can be folded flat
by simple folds,

1620
01:20:30,730 --> 01:20:32,550
and the answer would be no here.

1621
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:39,530
All you do is you say, well,
I know if there's any fold,

1622
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:41,850
I must have a mountain
or a valley that

1623
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:43,120
goes all the way through.

1624
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,900
So Imagine here's
your rectangle.

1625
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:47,150
There's got to be something
that's valley all the way.

1626
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:50,400

1627
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:56,010
Now, if you think about a crease
that goes the other direction,

1628
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:58,240
these are two valleys.

1629
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:01,700
You can show, just by playing
around with a little pattern

1630
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:05,414
like this, you cannot have
these two both be valleys

1631
01:21:05,414 --> 01:21:07,330
because that would be
all four valleys is bad.

1632
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:08,579
If you try that, doesn't work.

1633
01:21:08,579 --> 01:21:10,070
Or it also can't
be both mountains.

1634
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:12,420
You can't valley, mountain,
valley, mountain in order.

1635
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:13,455
That doesn't fold.

1636
01:21:13,455 --> 01:21:15,080
So in fact, these
have to be different.

1637
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,310
One's mountain, one's valley.

1638
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:19,040
I don't care which is which, but
I know that this line actually

1639
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,640
cannot be folded
by a simple fold.

1640
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,470
It's got a valley
and a mountain.

1641
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:27,310
So in fact, the picture has
to be I have a line like this.

1642
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:30,140
Maybe I have a few lines that
are mountains all the way

1643
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:33,300
or valleys all the way.

1644
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:36,190
And any horizontal
line I can't fold.

1645
01:21:36,190 --> 01:21:38,430
I've got to finish
folding these guys first.

1646
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:41,030
That means I have a one
dimensional problem.

1647
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:43,290
So I apply this algorithm
to see whether that one

1648
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:45,220
dimensional thing folds.

1649
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:48,241
Once I've folded all
those vertical things,

1650
01:21:48,241 --> 01:21:49,740
solved that one
dimensional problem,

1651
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:51,427
I will then have a
horizontal problem,

1652
01:21:51,427 --> 01:21:53,010
and then I'll have
a vertical problem.

1653
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:54,682
You just keep
doing this, and you

1654
01:21:54,682 --> 01:21:56,140
can show in the
same way you always

1655
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:57,380
preserve flat foldability.

1656
01:21:57,380 --> 01:21:59,522
You just keep doing
crimps and end folds,

1657
01:21:59,522 --> 01:22:00,980
and this will fold
your map if it's

1658
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:03,790
at all possible by simple
folds, which most ones that

1659
01:22:03,790 --> 01:22:06,500
are in production are
foldable by simple folds.

1660
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,325
Question?

1661
01:22:07,325 --> 01:22:07,950
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1662
01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:10,920
If we go back to the
example where that valley

1663
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:14,534
around this one, and valley
here and mountain here.

1664
01:22:14,534 --> 01:22:15,200
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1665
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,390
If we fold the vertical valley,

1666
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:27,374
AUDIENCE: the valley goes on the
mountain, it would be reversed

1667
01:22:27,374 --> 01:22:29,724
and then it would be
foldable by that sequence.

1668
01:22:29,724 --> 01:22:30,390
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1669
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:31,270
This is good.

1670
01:22:31,270 --> 01:22:33,030
This is the case
that could work.

1671
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:35,060
This is foldable
if you try it out.

1672
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:37,540
You first told here,
and then the valley

1673
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:40,530
falls onto the mountain but it
turns upside down as it folds,

1674
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:42,900
and so they actually nest
nicely inside each other.

1675
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:44,680
It's confusing because
it's inverting.

1676
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,864
This is the one valley
case, but my point

1677
01:22:46,864 --> 01:22:48,780
is you have to fold this
before you fold that.

1678
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:51,620

1679
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:53,620
There's a little more
details in the notes here.

1680
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:56,120
You can make this into a really
fast linear time algorithm

1681
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,495
if you use fancy
data structures,

1682
01:22:57,495 --> 01:23:01,380
but that's beyond
this scope, and that

1683
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:04,200
is the end of Lecture 2.
