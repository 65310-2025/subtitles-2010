1
0-1:59:59,500 --> 00:00:04,400

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,870
PROFESSOR: Today we begin the
third major part of the class.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,630
We've done paper
folding, linkage folding,

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,880
and now we're going to
do polyhedron folding.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:25,360

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,720
The very last topic we
did was hinged dissection,

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,684
which is somewhere in the
middle of all these things.

8
00:00:30,684 --> 00:00:32,100
But with polyhedron
folding, we're

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,150
thinking about a two
dimensional surface

10
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:40,260
in 3D, something like
a cube, and we're

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:50,790
interested in cutting along
the edges of that shape

12
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,970
or somehow cutting along
the surface-- that's

13
00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:02,990
a good cutting-- and then
unfolding into some flat shape.

14
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:10,270

15
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,420
So this is a standard cross
unfolding of the cube.

16
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,810
This is the unfolding process,
and of course the reverse

17
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:24,590
is the folding process, and
both of them are interesting.

18
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,850
We're going to start
thinking about unfolding.

19
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,690
That's one of the most
practical problems here.

20
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:35,360
You really want to build some
3D shape out of sheet material.

21
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,430
What shape do you
cut out in order

22
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,801
to bend it into that surface?

23
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,050
So you start with the surface.

24
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,610
You need to figure out where
to cut so that when you unfold,

25
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,787
you get something
that has no overlap.

26
00:01:47,787 --> 00:01:49,370
If you want to make
it from one sheet,

27
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,910
it shouldn't have any overlap,
and ideally just one piece

28
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,470
because then you have to do
less welding or edge joining

29
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,730
to make that surface.

30
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,496
So today and the
next couple lectures

31
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:04,620
will be all about unfolding,
and then eventually we

32
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,880
will turn to the reverse
problem, folding problem.

33
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,940
And there are two
kinds of unfolding.

34
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,980
The one that I just
drew is an edge

35
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,510
unfolding because it
only cuts along edges.

36
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:33,470
Edge unfolding only cut
along edges of the surface.

37
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,510
This property is nice.

38
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,580
If you're building
something, you

39
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,590
don't want to have
visible seams.

40
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,350
You have to be
bent at the edges,

41
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,570
so it's not such a big
deal if you're also

42
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,467
fusing along an edge.

43
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,550
But in general, you could
imagine cutting anywhere

44
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,840
on the surface, and
this is an example

45
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,560
where the solid red
lines are cutting

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,500
on what you see and the
dotted red lines were

47
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,010
cutting on the backside.

48
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,650
And when you unfold that thing,
you get this stoplight polygon,

49
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,120
and this is what we call a
general unfolding, or just

50
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,790
unfolding.

51
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,510
There you can cut anywhere.

52
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:16,310
In both cases, we want
one piece, no overlap,

53
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,240
but you can change where
you're allowed to cut.

54
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:39,730

55
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,620
So those are the
rules of the game,

56
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,080
or two possible
rules of the game.

57
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,850
And let me tell you what's
known about these kinds

58
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,430
of unfoldings.

59
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,560
I've mentioned it way
back in lecture one.

60
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:26,329

61
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:27,870
so we can think
about edge unfolding,

62
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,411
we can think about
general unfolding,

63
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:31,840
and we can think about
them for convex polyhedra--

64
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,080
simple things like the
cube have no dents--

65
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,850
or general polyhedra,
non-convex polyhedra.

66
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:45,260
And status is these
two corners are open.

67
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,360

68
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,155
This one is solved.

69
00:04:52,155 --> 00:04:53,460
It can always be done.

70
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,800
You can always generally
unfold a convex polyhedron,

71
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,580
but we don't know about
general polyhedra.

72
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,310
Edge unfolding of
convex polyhedra,

73
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,819
we don't know whether
it's possible,

74
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:06,360
but for non-convex
polyhedra, we know

75
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,944
that's too much to hope for.

76
00:05:07,944 --> 00:05:10,670

77
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,890
Not always possible.

78
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,900
Both of these questions
could go either way,

79
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,820
but we know in various
generalizations, easy case

80
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,950
of convex polyhedra general
unfolding, we can do it.

81
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,760
The most restrictive,
hardest situation

82
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,970
is edge unfolding
non-convex polyhedra.

83
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,180
That's too much.

84
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,481
But each of these
things, we don't know.

85
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:35,480
And these are some of the
biggest open questions

86
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,830
remaining in geometric folding
algorithms, this field.

87
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:46,970
I'm going to talk mostly
about these three things

88
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:52,080
today, so this open problem
and these two results.

89
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,420
And then this topic will
essentially be next lecture.

90
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,665
Obviously it's not solved, but
we still have a lot to say.

91
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:01,040
There are various
partial results

92
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,140
toward solving both
of those problems,

93
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,090
I would say more on this one.

94
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,280
This one is five centuries old.

95
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,258
This one is one
decade old or so.

96
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:25,551

97
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,550
So I need to set the stage
a little bit before I

98
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,900
can talk about any
of these things,

99
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,180
so let me start with a
little bit of terminology.

100
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:39,720

101
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,560
We've in some sense talked
about curvature before.

102
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,310
I don't think I gave
it this name, though,

103
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,393
in the context of origami.

104
00:06:45,393 --> 00:06:50,360

105
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,490
And I use it almost
subconsciously

106
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,060
so it's good for
me to define it.

107
00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:00,310

108
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,240
If you have some vertex
on your polyhedron.

109
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,570
Let's say we're looking
at a corner of a cube,

110
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:12,160
so this has three 90 degree
angles coming together.

111
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,700
You sum those
angles, we get 270,

112
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,610
and then you take
360 minus that sum,

113
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,375
and that is your curvature.

114
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,680
This is going to be 90.

115
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,050
And what I really care about
is whether the curvature

116
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,090
is positive, 0, or negative.

117
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:38,792

118
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,750
Positive curvature, which
is what we got here--

119
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,220
this is plus 90-- is
like a convex cone.

120
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:51,470

121
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,860
So if you're thinking about
convex polyhedra, which

122
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,870
is one of the situations
we care about,

123
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:01,680
you'll always get positive or
0, maybe, curvature vertices,

124
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,620
depending on what
you're thinking about.

125
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,750
Zero, this is like
a piece of paper,

126
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,180
so this is what you might call
flat, but it's locally flat.

127
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,700
It could be drawn
flat or we know

128
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,290
how to fold pieces of paper.

129
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,880
You never change the curvature.

130
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,700
The sum of the
instant face angles

131
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,230
will always stay the same, no
matter how you fold this thing.

132
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,313
Curvature is an invariant.

133
00:08:22,313 --> 00:08:25,280

134
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,520
If you just think locally and
forget about the actual folding

135
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,669
of the thing, it's kind of flat.

136
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:33,860
So you can think of this
as a piece of paper.

137
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,460
We talked about
these two situations

138
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,211
in the context of Kawasaki's
theorem way back when.

139
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:39,669
Kawasaki's theorem
applied for both

140
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,030
of these for the negative
curvature case, which

141
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,720
is when you have lots
of material all joined

142
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,040
at a single point,
something like this.

143
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,800

144
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,200
Then Kawasaki's theorem
changed a little bit.

145
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,894
There were some other
cases that could happen.

146
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:02,310
So when you have
tons of material,

147
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,269
this can only happen in
a non-convex polyhedron.

148
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:06,310
That's sort of the point.

149
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,895
If you're a convex
polyhedron, you

150
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:10,870
know you have to have
only these two situations.

151
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,260
Where do you get flat vertices?

152
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,990
Well, if you think of
this point as a vertex

153
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,380
and you add up all the angles
around it, well, that's 360.

154
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,720
360 minus 360 is 0.

155
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,100
So you have zero curvature on
all the faces and on the edges.

156
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,830
Also, if you look here,
you have 180 and other 180.

157
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,040
That adds to 360.

158
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,030
And then at the actual
vertices, that's

159
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,840
where you have positive
curvature for a convex

160
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,320
polyhedron.

161
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,840
So just some terminology.

162
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,340
Get used to the idea of positive
curvature, zero curvature,

163
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,298
and negative curvature.

164
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:45,730

165
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:50,180
Then we have the
idea of a cutting.

166
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,900
So cutting is just,
what edges do you cut?

167
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,240
It's the red stuff
in this picture.

168
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,360
What edges do you cut
in order to unfold?

169
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,230
So this is an unfolding, the
mapping here, but the red part,

170
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,269
I'll call it cutting.

171
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,935
Sometimes it's also
called an unfolding,

172
00:10:04,935 --> 00:10:06,393
but that can be a
little confusing.

173
00:10:06,393 --> 00:10:17,440

174
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,630
The main point here is I want
to talk about what constraints

175
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,650
cutting must satisfy in order
to be valid so we can just

176
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,380
get a sense of what
is happening here.

177
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:34,430
If you look at these pictures,
you can see two properties.

178
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,820
One is that the cuttings
visit all the vertices

179
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,390
of the polyhedron.

180
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,110
So there's this red stuff.

181
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,240
The red stuff is connected.

182
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,850
It's acyclic, so it's actually
a tree in these pictures,

183
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,380
and it's visiting
all the corners.

184
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,830
Even back here, it's
visited on the back.

185
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,050
Is that always true?

186
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,160
Most of those properties
are mostly true,

187
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,650
but it depends a little bit.

188
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:05,080
One thing that is
sure is the cutting

189
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:11,515
must span all non-zero
curvature vertices.

190
00:11:11,515 --> 00:11:15,130

191
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:21,560
But I do have to say
"non-zero curvature." "Spans"

192
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,560
just means visits.

193
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,830
You have to hit all the
vertices of non-zero curvature

194
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,050
because anything of
non-zero curvature

195
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,860
can't be flattened by itself.

196
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,750
It needs to be cut.

197
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,090

198
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,140
At that point, the cutting has
to have degree at least one.

199
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,290

200
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,590
With zero curvature
vertices, even if they're not

201
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,995
flat in three dimensions,
you could flatten them

202
00:11:46,995 --> 00:11:49,120
because we know locally,
it really is a flat thing.

203
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,484
So there may not be any cuts
at zero curvature vertices.

204
00:11:51,484 --> 00:11:53,650
Most of the time, we won't
have to worry about them,

205
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,200
but something to think about.

206
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,940
Everybody else you have to span.

207
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:03,470

208
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,520
You can say even more.

209
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,180
If you have very
negative curvature,

210
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,760
if the curvature of a vertex
is less than some integer,

211
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:23,520
k times 360 with a minus
sign in front, then cutting

212
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:32,260
must have degree strictly
more than k plus 1.

213
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,180
So if you have
negative curvature,

214
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:38,764
you know you have to
have at least two cuts

215
00:12:38,764 --> 00:12:40,680
for a negative curvature
vertex because if you

216
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,770
had negative curvature--
one of these things--

217
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,880
you made a single cut.

218
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,570
Then all that material
is still there.

219
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,990
If you then flattened it,
it's going to overlap itself

220
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,865
because you're trying
to flatten it into 360.

221
00:12:50,865 --> 00:12:53,580
There's more than
360 material there.

222
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:57,090
So negative curvature already,
you need two vertices.

223
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,630
That's the plus 1 here.

224
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:06,110
And as soon as you get to
smaller than negative 360,

225
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,860
then you have to have at least
three cuts and so on, just

226
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,425
to partition up into
at most 360 groups.

227
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:14,200

228
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,420
This is useful.

229
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,670
Negative curvature is basically
really tough to unfold

230
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,820
and we'll use that to make
counter examples here.

231
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,390
What else?

232
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:35,440

233
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:47,665
your polyhedron has no handles,
then cutting has no cycles.

234
00:13:47,665 --> 00:13:56,120

235
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,900
A handle is something
of higher genus.

236
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,616
If this is your polyhedron,
we call this a handle.

237
00:14:03,616 --> 00:14:04,990
You have sort of
a blob down here

238
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,230
and you have a connection
from one place to the other.

239
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,100
If you have a
handle, you can have

240
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,280
a cycle of cuts like this
that does not disconnect

241
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,050
the surface, but we
basically never think

242
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,855
about that situation.

243
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,980
Whenever we're thinking of
something of genus zero,

244
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:25,239
like a convex polyhedron or a
regular, non-convex polyhedron,

245
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,280
you really shouldn't have
a cycle in your cutting

246
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,750
because if you
had a cycle, you'd

247
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,420
disconnect your
surface into two parts

248
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,900
normally, if you're like
a sphere or like a disk.

249
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,730

250
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,410
That's the acyclic
condition and when it holds.

251
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,560
Some other good things.

252
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:56,730

253
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:08,060
If a polyhedron has no
boundary and no handles,

254
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:24,780
and the unfolding has
no holes, then cutting

255
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,210
is a spanning tree.

256
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,730

257
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,030
Spanning tree, it's a concept
we've used a few times.

258
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,880
It's just a tree.

259
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,100
In this case, it's got
to visit all the vertices

260
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,630
of non-zero curvature and
it's a tree, so it's connected

261
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,950
and it's acyclic.

262
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,910
The main new thing here
is that it's connected.

263
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,770
We've already said
that it should

264
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,870
be acyclic with no
handles, we've already

265
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,530
said that it should
span everybody,

266
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,830
so it's sort of a
summary theorem,

267
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,020
but we have a whole
bunch of conditions here.

268
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:01,660
In particular, this will hold
if your polyhedron is convex.

269
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,270

270
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,950
So for convex polyhedra,
you have a spanning tree,

271
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,282
and that's what's going
on in this picture even

272
00:16:12,282 --> 00:16:13,240
for general unfoldings.

273
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,440
That's the interesting case.

274
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,190
Here, it's maybe more
obvious, here it's

275
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,660
a little less obvious.

276
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:25,050
And to sort of see what could go
wrong here, I have an example.

277
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,710
This is a non-convex polyhedron.

278
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,770
There's a whole
bunch of views of it

279
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,830
up here, and in
particular this top view.

280
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,210
What we're doing is slicing
along just those two

281
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,682
edges and some other
stuff around the outside,

282
00:16:38,682 --> 00:16:40,390
but in particular, we
cut those two edges

283
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:45,560
and there aren't any
other cuts around there.

284
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,110
A polyhedron is set up so
that when you open it up,

285
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,600
this works out.

286
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,670
It's nice and flat.

287
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,780
This is extremely rare.

288
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,250
If you perturbed this
example, it wouldn't hold.

289
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,780
But you can set things up
so that, in fact, what's

290
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,820
happening is that the total
curvature-- this vertex has

291
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,650
positive curvature, this has
negative, this has positive,

292
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,800
and the sum of those
three curvatures is zero,

293
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,180
and that's what
allows this to be flat

294
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,050
because the total curvature
in that little region is zero,

295
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,250
and that's when things
are allowed to be flat.

296
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,490
So you can cut here and make
a separate collection of cuts

297
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,380
on the outside, but
it's disconnected,

298
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,280
so this is kind of weird.

299
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,520
Most of the time, things
will be connected,

300
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,102
and as long as your
unfolding has no holes--

301
00:17:28,102 --> 00:17:29,560
and for an unfolding
to have holes,

302
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,143
you'd have to have
this weird property

303
00:17:31,143 --> 00:17:33,770
that a bunch of curvatures sum
to zero like in that picture--

304
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,410
as long as you don't
have that, you're OK.

305
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:41,934

306
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:43,100
Let's get to these theorems.

307
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,320

308
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,810
Actually, one thing
related to this problem,

309
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,920
general unfolding of
arbitrary polyhedra,

310
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,620
is you can't be too
general what you

311
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,000
mean by non-convex polyhedra.

312
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,170
So we have this example.

313
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,830
It's the simplest nasty
polyhedron there is this.

314
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,205
It has one vertex at the
top there with a big dot

315
00:18:08,205 --> 00:18:10,160
that has negative curvature.

316
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,490
There's more than 360
degrees of material

317
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,682
from all these triangles.

318
00:18:14,682 --> 00:18:16,140
And that's sort of
all that it has.

319
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,430
This is the polyhedron.

320
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,360
This is what we call
boundary of the polyhedron.

321
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,860
So far, all the polyhedra
I've done haven't had that,

322
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,930
and you may have
seen that I assumed

323
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:29,108
that it wasn't there
for that last lemma.

324
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:34,160
This polyhedron can't
be unfolded at all

325
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,240
in one piece, no overlap.

326
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,440
Why?

327
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,809
Because it has one vertex.

328
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:41,350
You could think of
these as vertices,

329
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,484
but they're kind of flat.

330
00:18:42,484 --> 00:18:44,150
Everything's flat
except that one point.

331
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,500
It has negative curvature.

332
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,400
Negative curvature,
we said you have

333
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
to have at least two
cuts coming in there.

334
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,880
If you just made one cut, then
when you flatten this thing,

335
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,950
it'll overlap itself locally.

336
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,440
So there's got to be at least
two cuts coming in there.

337
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,410
I don't think that
even matters much.

338
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,350
I mean, there's at
least one, certainly.

339
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,390
Where could those
guys go, those cuts?

340
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,310
They have to wander
around the surface.

341
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,720
If they just stop in
the middle of nowhere,

342
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,929
then you're sort of doing
nothing because a cut that just

343
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:15,470
stops in the middle
of a flat vertex,

344
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,520
well, you might as well
not have done that cut,

345
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,734
so you could erase it.

346
00:19:18,734 --> 00:19:19,900
So it's got to go somewhere.

347
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,400
They could go to each other, in
which case you've made a cycle

348
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,650
and then you've disconnected
your surface because this

349
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,570
is like a disk, or they
could go to the boundary.

350
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,150
And if they both
go to the boundary,

351
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,140
again, you disconnect
your surface, two pieces.

352
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,620
So this is kind of pathetic,
but you can't unfold this

353
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,740
with one piece, no overlap.

354
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,620
So when I say, in
this picture, and I

355
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,300
say that it's open whether
non-convex polyhedra can

356
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,520
be generally unfolded, I
mean non-convex polyhedra

357
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,270
without boundary.

358
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,455
I'll even give you
handles if you want.

359
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:54,280
I'm not sure that
it matters too much,

360
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,370
but boundary seems to
make a big difference.

361
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,840
So what's wrong
is this polyhedron

362
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,710
is kind of incomplete,
and as long

363
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,880
as you close it up somehow
and don't have these boundary

364
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,060
effects, then maybe you can
generally unfold everything.

365
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,100
That's this question.

366
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:18,910

367
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,750
That was a little bit on this.

368
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,440
We'll come back to
it more next lecture.

369
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,860
Next, I want to do this one,
general unfolding of convex

370
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,370
polyhedra.

371
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,610
This is really the most
positive news I could give you.

372
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,700

373
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,040
All this unfolding stuff,
it's the one good result.

374
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,757
We know several good results,
but in terms of that table,

375
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:42,840
it's our only good result.

376
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,520

377
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,030
And to do that, there's a bunch
of solutions to this problem.

378
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,095
They all use the idea
of shortest paths.

379
00:20:52,095 --> 00:21:11,040

380
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,710
The shortest path is a
path that's shortest.

381
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:18,640
So you have some surface,
you have some points.

382
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,140
You do this all the
time when you're

383
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,740
flying between two cities.

384
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,370
You follow a shortest
path on a sphere.

385
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,120
It's not straight
in three dimensions.

386
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,390
It's the shortest thing subject
to lying on that surface, what

387
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,810
is the shortest path you can do?

388
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,217
So you're used to
it on a sphere.

389
00:21:33,217 --> 00:21:34,800
It's a little weirder
on a polyhedron,

390
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,020
but it's just the same idea.

391
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,070
Take all the possible paths you
could, find the shortest one.

392
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,500
You fix the two
endpoints, x and y,

393
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,760
and you get to optimize this.

394
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,360
Whatever is shortest
is the right thing.

395
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:52,160
I have some pictures of
what they look like here.

396
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,740
So these are some
convex polyhedra.

397
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,550
They're probably random
points on a sphere,

398
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,150
take the convex hull.

399
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:04,310
And then we pick some vertex,
or some point x in the corner

400
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,310
there, and this is
computing the shortest paths

401
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,860
from x to every other
vertex on the polyhedron.

402
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,180
So they look very
straight in this case

403
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,930
because the polyhedron
is almost a sphere.

404
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,520
They look kind of like great
circular arcs on a sphere,

405
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,630
but they're not quite.

406
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,710
You can look carefully
at an edge here,

407
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,970
this does bend a little bit.

408
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,690
It's a bit subtle.

409
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,530
It bends only a little bit
because the property you want

410
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,630
is if you look at this
triangle and this triangle

411
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,560
and you unfold
them-- so right now,

412
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,610
they have some dihedral
angle between them,

413
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,680
and if you open it out
so that they're flat,

414
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,650
then this line
should be straight.

415
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,760
Still the case that shortest
paths are straight lines,

416
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,910
but only when you unfold.

417
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:45,762
That's the idea.

418
00:22:45,762 --> 00:22:47,720
So if you look at all
the triangles are visited

419
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,706
by a path, and you unfold them
to be a straight thing-- this

420
00:22:50,706 --> 00:22:54,170
is called developing, you
flatten it out-- then actually,

421
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,920
the shortest path will
be a straight line,

422
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,190
so that makes it really
easy to draw these things.

423
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,750
There still might be multiple
candidates, like to get here,

424
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,110
should I go this way or
the other way around,

425
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:06,965
but each of those will
be locally straight,

426
00:23:06,965 --> 00:23:08,590
and this is a property
called geodesic.

427
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:13,130

428
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:16,842
Shortest paths always
unfold straight.

429
00:23:16,842 --> 00:23:18,800
And in general, anything
that unfolds straight,

430
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,200
it might not even be
shortest, is a geodesic.

431
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,610

432
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,090
These are like locally shortest.

433
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,410
Locally, you can't
make them any shorter,

434
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,770
but they might have
made the wrong choice.

435
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,520
They might have gone
around the wrong way.

436
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,900

437
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,025
Geodesic means going
straight for a long time.

438
00:23:37,025 --> 00:23:38,650
You could actually
spiral around and do

439
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,110
all sorts of crazy things.

440
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:49,940
But shortest paths
never cross themselves

441
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,466
because if you had the shortest
path that crossed itself,

442
00:23:52,466 --> 00:23:53,340
that wasn't shortest.

443
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,480
You should have just
gotten rid of this part

444
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,330
and gone straight
through the crossing.

445
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,060
That's sort of trivial.

446
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,375
And there's another
good, fun property

447
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,830
that you may not have
noticed in those figures,

448
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:14,365
but they never pass through
positive curvature vertex.

449
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:24,860

450
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,560
So if you look at
these pictures,

451
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,130
they might end at a
positive curvature vertex

452
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,460
because that's where we told
the shortest path to go,

453
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,550
but in the middle, they're
always crossing edges.

454
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,420
This is a convex polyhedron so
everything's positive curvature

455
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,310
or zero.

456
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,890
In that case, the
paths can really only

457
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:43,300
go through zero
curvature points.

458
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,510
They might start
and end wherever,

459
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,510
but in between, they
never hit a corner.

460
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,480
Why?

461
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,700
Because if you have a
positive curvature vertex--

462
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,200
I'm just going to sketch this
idea-- if you went up here

463
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,050
in order to go back down
somewhere like there,

464
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:03,180
it's always better to
shortcut a little bit

465
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,230
and not go through the vertex.

466
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,776
It's better to go around
one way or the other.

467
00:25:07,776 --> 00:25:10,380
I'm just going to wave my
hands at that, but it's true.

468
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,050

469
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:13,982
So what?

470
00:25:13,982 --> 00:25:16,190
Shortest paths are going to
be a really powerful tool

471
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,148
for finding unfoldings.

472
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:25,030

473
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:32,140
In particular, I want to
define the star, that picture,

474
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,900
of all shortest
paths from one point.

475
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:50,130

476
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,270
And do I want points here?

477
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,460
I think I want vertices.

478
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,407

479
00:25:57,407 --> 00:25:58,740
That's the picture that we drew.

480
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:03,431

481
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:05,930
The interesting thing about all
the shortest paths, they all

482
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:09,804
start from the same point,
they never hit each other.

483
00:26:09,804 --> 00:26:11,470
So not only does a
shortest path not hit

484
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:15,030
itself, but if you take many
shortest paths, or even two

485
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:18,450
shortest paths from a
common starting point,

486
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,300
they can't hit each other.

487
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,290
It could be one is
a subset of another.

488
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,359
For example, if I took
the shortest path to here

489
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:29,400
and then I also took the
shortest path to a point

490
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,580
just beyond it,
well, one's going

491
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,880
to be a prefix of the other.

492
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,360
Other than that, they will
never cross each other.

493
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,430
I'm going to just assert
that, not prove it here.

494
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,150
So really, it does
look like a star.

495
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,460
In fact, you could fill
in more shortest paths.

496
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,930
You could take the shortest
path to here, for example,

497
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,710
and it'll fit in nicely, kind
of bisect that angle in there.

498
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,650
It's a very simple
kind of structure.

499
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,620
It's just from a point, you
have all this stuff going out.

500
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:05,150
They never hit each
other except at something

501
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:11,912
called the cut locus, also
called the ridge tree.

502
00:27:11,912 --> 00:27:17,590

503
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:27,175
And these are points with
non-unique shortest paths to x.

504
00:27:27,175 --> 00:27:37,460

505
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,415
So we're fixing some point, x.

506
00:27:39,415 --> 00:27:45,310

507
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,660
So here's a simpler polyhedron.

508
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,610
It's just a
square-based pyramid.

509
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:53,560
We're picking x to be in
the middle of this face,

510
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,610
and drawn in these black
lines are the shortest paths

511
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,680
from x to all the vertices.

512
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,940
Here, that's a straight line.

513
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,120
This one, if you unfolded
it, it would be straight,

514
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,250
and there's some similar
ones on the back.

515
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,560
And I think this is the back
in case you want to see.

516
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,230

517
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:16,370
There's one back face that you
can't see at all, C, behind B

518
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:20,477
here, and that's
what it looks like.

519
00:28:20,477 --> 00:28:21,810
There's no shortest paths there.

520
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,310
Now, there's these dashed lines.

521
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,140
That's the ridge tree.

522
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,500
That's the cut locus.

523
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:32,830
And these are points on the
backside with respect to x.

524
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:36,760
If you're going from x,
you go around behind to C,

525
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,830
or you could go from x around
behind to D and then to C.

526
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:46,540
At some point, those things meet
and are still of equal length.

527
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,470
So here, if you're
trying to go to x,

528
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,300
you could go around this way or
you could go around this way.

529
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,730
They will be the same
length, and all the points

530
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,186
with that property
are the dashed lines.

531
00:28:58,186 --> 00:29:00,310
Now, if you're familiar
with [? Vornar ?] diagrams,

532
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:05,200
this is the [? Vornar ?]
diagram of one point, x.

533
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,660
Imagine you plant grass over
your polyhedron, you light

534
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:14,750
a fire here, it burns at
uniform speed in all directions.

535
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,210
Where the fire meets
itself on the backside,

536
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,040
that is the ridge tree.

537
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,530
That is the
[? Vornar ?] diagram.

538
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,910
So it's kind of intuitive
that it's there.

539
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,080
Maybe less obvious
is that it's a tree

540
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,150
and it's a spanning tree.

541
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,191
It hits all the vertices.

542
00:29:28,191 --> 00:29:31,740

543
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,890
So it's a natural cutting.

544
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:37,830
That's why it's
called the cut locus,

545
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,120
and it works really well.

546
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:57,859

547
00:29:57,859 --> 00:29:59,400
And it's called the
source unfolding.

548
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:11,190

549
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,230
Source unfolding goes
back to the mid '80s.

550
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,030
A bunch of people
discovered it for

551
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,510
various computational
geometry applications.

552
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,130
They didn't care about
unfolding at the time.

553
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:25,140
And it's kind of obvious after
you think about it for a while,

554
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,780
trying to solve this
general unfolding problem.

555
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:36,470
Once you have this structure,
cut along the cut locus,

556
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:42,605
unfold the star of
shortest paths from x.

557
00:30:42,605 --> 00:30:46,270

558
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,700
So let's do it for this example.

559
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,360
It's the same
example on the left.

560
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,650
This is the star unfolding.

561
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:56,390
I've just splayed out
everything, so at the boundary,

562
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,070
I'm cutting at the dashed part.

563
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,320
That's the cut locus.

564
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,820
Ignore these little
dashed lines.

565
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,780
Those are just edges, unfolded.

566
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,990
And what's happening is that
all the shortest paths are all

567
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,700
here.

568
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,990
If I look at any shortest path
from x on the left diagram,

569
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:20,330
I can map it to a line
segment starting from x.

570
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,600
x was a flat vertex.

571
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,950
It has 360 degrees of
material around it.

572
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,400
I just chose it to be somewhere
in the middle somewhere.

573
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,090
Doesn't matter other than that.

574
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:31,600
And now there's 360 degrees of
material on the flat unfolding.

575
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,620
That's great.

576
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,840
And you pick any
direction here, you

577
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,120
can map it to a corresponding
direction over there

578
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,280
on the surface, see where
that shortest path would

579
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,350
go if you kept going until
you were no longer shortest.

580
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:47,200
When you stop being shortest,
the edge of that place

581
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,130
is the ridge tree, and
that's where you cut.

582
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,084
You stop your segment there.

583
00:31:54,084 --> 00:31:56,500
So it's actually pretty obvious
this thing doesn't overlap

584
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,120
because all of
these shortest paths

585
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,440
are going in different
directions from x.

586
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,950
What you have is what we call
a star shaped polygon around x.

587
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,560
Every point on the
surface is visible from x

588
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,590
because we just sort of
unrolled it to be right there.

589
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,050
That's the source unfolding.

590
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,850
It's a little hard to
see the 3D diagrams,

591
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:20,085
but it's actually really easy
once you draw those shortest

592
00:32:20,085 --> 00:32:20,585
paths.

593
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:26,180

594
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:29,484
So the source unfolding
is star shaped.

595
00:32:29,484 --> 00:32:31,650
We have another unfolding
called the star unfolding,

596
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,161
which is not star shaped.

597
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:33,785
Very confusing.

598
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,730

599
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:40,210
I mean, what you call one
doesn't matter too much.

600
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:43,620
This unfolding was
mentioned in 1948

601
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,240
by Alexandrov, who
we'll be hearing

602
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,770
about more in the
future, but wasn't

603
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:52,270
improved to
non-overlap until '92.

604
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,070
So this one is much less
obvious that it doesn't overlap,

605
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,060
and I'm not going
to prove it here.

606
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,970
But it goes back to
this idea of star.

607
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,450
Say, OK, this cut locus
is nice, but let's

608
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,550
focus on the star
of shortest paths

609
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:08,250
from one point to all
the other vertices.

610
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:14,100
Instead of keeping those paths
as the things that you unroll,

611
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,200
what if we cut along them?

612
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,930
It's another natural thing to
try and it turns out to work.

613
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,880

614
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,150
So here, we cut along the star.

615
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,430
We've already
proved this result,

616
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,540
every convex polyhedron
is generally unfoldable.

617
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,090
Just with that picture,
it's very easy.

618
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,490
But hey, it's fun to have more.

619
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,270
And this is what the
star unfolding looks

620
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,490
like for the same example.

621
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:48,575
This is a little less obvious,
but if you think about it,

622
00:33:48,575 --> 00:33:49,950
the star, the set
of all shortest

623
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:53,000
paths to all the vertices,
is a spanning tree.

624
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,780
It hits all the vertices
because we told it to,

625
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,560
and it's a tree
because it's just

626
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,460
all these edges coming
together at a point.

627
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,820
So it's a natural cutting also.

628
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,350
And magically it works.

629
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:09,760
How it works is a
little less obvious.

630
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,150
You see here the ridge tree
drawn on the unfolding,

631
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,810
and you can see all the
parts and map the letter E,

632
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:19,909
this is the bottom square,
and stays connected.

633
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:22,010
It's just like you
reattach everything

634
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:26,010
around the ridge tree
and it doesn't overlap.

635
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:30,210

636
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:33,139
It's quite difficult, I think,
to give intuition why this

637
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:36,524
doesn't overlap, but it doesn't.

638
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:42,678

639
00:34:42,678 --> 00:34:44,219
I'll wave my hands
at some point when

640
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:47,190
we have the necessary
tools to prove it,

641
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,074
I can mention how it's done.

642
00:34:49,074 --> 00:34:50,199
But we don't have them yet.

643
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:52,198
We'll get them in a couple
of lectures, I think.

644
00:34:52,198 --> 00:34:55,650

645
00:34:55,650 --> 00:35:01,760
These results can be extended
also in various directions.

646
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,485
Let me tell you briefly
about some extensions.

647
00:35:04,485 --> 00:35:10,350

648
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,870
For a long time, these
were the two ways

649
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,880
to solve that problem
and that was sort of it.

650
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,064

651
00:35:17,064 --> 00:35:19,480
It would be nice, for example,
to have some general family

652
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,021
of unfoldings that includes the
star unfolding and the source

653
00:35:22,021 --> 00:35:23,989
unfolding and there's
something in the middle,

654
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:25,780
but we don't necessarily
know what that is.

655
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,792
Do you have a question?

656
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:27,708
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

657
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:32,807

658
00:35:32,807 --> 00:35:35,140
PROFESSOR: How do you find
the creases is your question?

659
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:39,502

660
00:35:39,502 --> 00:35:41,710
You find the creases because
you know for every point

661
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,870
here where it was
on the surface,

662
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:47,200
and if it was on an edge,
then it's a crease point.

663
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,450
That's the easy way to do it.

664
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,345

665
00:35:50,345 --> 00:35:52,220
I don't know if that's
a satisfactory answer,

666
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,561
but it can be done.

667
00:35:54,561 --> 00:35:57,270
AUDIENCE: Does it matter
where you choose x to be?

668
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:00,160
PROFESSOR: Does it matter
where you choose x to be?

669
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,060
It will change the unfolding.

670
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,911
It will never overlap,
but in that sense

671
00:36:05,911 --> 00:36:07,660
there's a whole family
of star unfoldings,

672
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,770
depending on where you move x.

673
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,300
There's a whole family
of source unfoldings

674
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,549
depending on where you move x.

675
00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:15,240
AUDIENCE: Does it make it
more efficient, any choice?

676
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,840
PROFESSOR: I mean,
some of the unfoldings

677
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,634
might have more cuts,
some might have less cuts.

678
00:36:20,634 --> 00:36:22,050
You're going to
get more cuts when

679
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,260
you have-- depends
how you count.

680
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:29,260
In some sense, there's only
n cuts, n shortest paths.

681
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:33,460
But a shortest path
might cut over many faces

682
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,640
or it might just
cut over one face.

683
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,447
Depends where x is.

684
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:39,030
If you choose x to
be in a nice place,

685
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,950
maybe you could get
away with fewer cuts

686
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:46,040
and have to do less welding, but
there's no theory about that.

687
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,722
More questions.

688
00:36:47,722 --> 00:36:50,520
AUDIENCE: So it doesn't
matter where you put x.

689
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,466
If it works at one spot, it
basically works at every spot.

690
00:36:54,466 --> 00:36:55,622
[INAUDIBLE]?

691
00:36:55,622 --> 00:36:57,080
PROFESSOR: For
convex polyhedra, it

692
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,650
works no matter where you put x.

693
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,230
For non-convex polyhedra, some
x's might work, some might not.

694
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,830

695
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,374
Here, let me show you.

696
00:37:08,374 --> 00:37:09,540
Here's more star unfoldings.

697
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,530
Cool.

698
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:14,820
They're really crazy looking
and not really star shaped.

699
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,910
There isn't one point
that can see everything.

700
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:21,120
They look kind of spiky like a
star, but it's quite different.

701
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,290
These are random
points on a sphere,

702
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:26,236
like take 42 random points on
a sphere, take the convex hull,

703
00:37:26,236 --> 00:37:27,360
then take a star unfolding.

704
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,120

705
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:34,560
Here's an example with
a non-convex polyhedron.

706
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,670
So one thing we hoped for
for a little while briefly

707
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,440
was that if you only had one
vertex of negative curvature,

708
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,074
which is this one, maybe if
you choose x to be right there

709
00:37:46,074 --> 00:37:47,740
and did the star
unfolding, because that

710
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,360
cuts x into lots of
little tiny pieces, then

711
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:55,210
maybe it would unfold about
overlap, but it doesn't work.

712
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,305
We were destroyed.

713
00:37:56,305 --> 00:37:59,149

714
00:37:59,149 --> 00:38:00,690
In fact, you can
show neither of them

715
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,200
will work in general for
a non-convex polyhedra,

716
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,520
so there's no hope of
solving this problem

717
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,930
with these techniques, at least
with these exact algorithms.

718
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:18,050

719
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:20,000
You might get lucky,
but most of the time,

720
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,380
I think they won't work.

721
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:30,190

722
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,910
Currently, x is a point.

723
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,871
You can actually
let x be-- I guess

724
00:38:35,871 --> 00:38:37,370
I'm not going to
be safe-- I'm going

725
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,250
to call it a geodesic path.

726
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,870
There's some restrictions
on when this is allowed,

727
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,430
but the idea is you
have your surface,

728
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:48,567
you take some straight
path on the surface,

729
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:50,400
and then you take
shortest paths from there.

730
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,580

731
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:58,050
And if you just think
about the source unfolding

732
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:01,804
where you keep x intact
and unfold from there,

733
00:39:01,804 --> 00:39:03,220
the picture is
going to look like,

734
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,340
well, you have
this straight line

735
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,160
when you unfold that
thing, and then you

736
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,060
have this nice star
of stuff around it.

737
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,550
And under some
simple conditions,

738
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,930
that will work without overlap.

739
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:18,030
What's more impressive is
that the star unfolding

740
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,484
works from a source like that.

741
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:21,900
Again, there are
some restrictions

742
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,749
on x that I'm not
going to define here,

743
00:39:23,749 --> 00:39:24,540
but it can be done.

744
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:28,620
These are two very recent
papers by O'Rourke and Itoh

745
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,709
and Vilku from the
last two years.

746
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:33,500
So that's exciting.

747
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:37,311
We now have four general methods
for unfolding convex polyhedra.

748
00:39:37,311 --> 00:39:38,560
Again, these are big families.

749
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,950
You can choose
any geodesic path.

750
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,440
Maybe some are
nicer than others.

751
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,890

752
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,360
You can do higher dimensions.

753
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:54,775

754
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:56,905
Star unfolding doesn't
really make sense

755
00:39:56,905 --> 00:39:57,780
in higher dimensions.

756
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,488
I don't think I've
thought about it much,

757
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,800
but source unfolding
makes sense.

758
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,920
So you have some four polytopes,
a little hard to imagine.

759
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,650
You take some point and
just radiate out from there,

760
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:11,940
unfold like that until you hit
yourself, and then you stop,

761
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,010
and that works in any dimension.

762
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:16,740
Source unfolding works
in any dimension.

763
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:22,370
That's fairly recent,
2003, Miller and Pak.

764
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:27,265
Another thing you can do
is continuous blooming.

765
00:40:27,265 --> 00:40:31,610

766
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:34,310
This is an idea posed by
Connolly several years

767
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:38,517
back and then solved
last year, I guess.

768
00:40:38,517 --> 00:40:39,600
It was presented in Japan.

769
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,160

770
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,742
This is about folded states
versus folding motions,

771
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:47,950
an issue we have thought
about many times in origami.

772
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,550
It was easy for any
polygonal piece of paper.

773
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:53,620
We could go from
unfolded to folded state

774
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,950
by a continuous motion
without self intersection.

775
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,900
For linkages, it
was the big deal.

776
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:01,530
It was all about, can
we get from a to b?

777
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:06,090
For convex polyhedra, you can
do it, continuous blooming.

778
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:10,170
This is in the middle of an
algorithm of continuously

779
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,470
blooming the source unfolding.

780
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,880
So here's our point x.

781
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,430
This is the cube, and
the source unfolding

782
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:19,490
of a cube for this
point x in the center

783
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:23,030
of a face, these four vertical
lines and then a little x

784
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,870
on the top side.

785
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:28,000
The algorithm unfolds
one edge at a time

786
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,540
but in a very specific order.

787
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:33,624
So it ends up unfolding this
entire house shape first,

788
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:35,290
and then it's done
one edge of this one,

789
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,581
and then it's going to fold
the other one down and then

790
00:41:37,581 --> 00:41:40,680
unfold one, two for the
backside, and then one,

791
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,170
two for the left side.

792
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,170
And you can show that
will not self intersect

793
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,560
as long as you had
a convex polyhedron.

794
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,064
It's not obvious but it's true.

795
00:41:50,064 --> 00:41:51,730
There are some other
results that if you

796
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:56,780
have any unfolding that doesn't
self intersect at the end,

797
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:01,305
you can add some cuts and make
it actually continuously bloom.

798
00:42:01,305 --> 00:42:02,865
It's kind of like
hinged dissections.

799
00:42:02,865 --> 00:42:04,720
It may not work by
itself, but you'd

800
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,950
cut the pieces into smaller
pieces and then it will work.

801
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:11,250
That's pretty good news,
and source unfolding just

802
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,120
works as is.

803
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,570

804
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,920
I might talk about that
some future lecture.

805
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,110

806
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,870
Not known, for example, whether
the star unfolding continuously

807
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:26,805
blooms.

808
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:30,250
That sounds a
little scary to me.

809
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,990
We don't actually have
an unfolding of a convex

810
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:36,440
polyhedron that does
not continuously bloom.

811
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,960
I think there should be one,
but that's an open problem.

812
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,060
Is this always possible, or
is there some crazy collection

813
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,150
of cuts that you cannot escape?

814
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:48,970

815
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:53,550
That's that, general
unfolding of convex polyhedra.

816
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:58,400
Let's turn to the--
it's not the last topic.

817
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,210
We still want to
cover both of these.

818
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:04,820
Next topic is edge unfolding
of convex polyhedra.

819
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,760
Now, this problem,
as I said, goes

820
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:12,590
back to 1525,
implicitly at least,

821
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:19,945
by this guy, Albrecht
Durer, who was a cool guy.

822
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:21,740
This is Renaissance time.

823
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,230
He did many different things.

824
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:25,659
I guess painter is maybe
his primary profession,

825
00:43:25,659 --> 00:43:27,200
but he did a lot of
different things.

826
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,800
He studied early perspective,
all that good stuff.

827
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,200
This is one of
his famous prints.

828
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,360
It was actually on display
at the MFA last year,

829
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,080
I got to see it, and it
has a little polyhedron

830
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,760
thrown in there.

831
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,200
It's a nice polyhedron.

832
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,100
How did he draw them?

833
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,651
Well, he probably built
models out of some material.

834
00:43:47,651 --> 00:43:49,150
And he was just
generally interested

835
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:51,220
in the third dimension
and understanding

836
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:55,140
how all these things worked, and
so he made a lot of unfoldings

837
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,580
in this book.

838
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,790
This is the original title.

839
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:00,400
Here's a translation.

840
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,640
Titles were a lot
longer in those days.

841
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,467
The Painter's Manual
is what I usually

842
00:44:04,467 --> 00:44:06,550
call it, "A Manual of
Measurement of Lines, Areas,

843
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:08,216
and Solids by Means
of Compass and Ruler

844
00:44:08,216 --> 00:44:10,780
Assembled by Albrecht Durer for
the Use of all Lovers of Art

845
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,405
with Appropriate
Illustrations Arranged

846
00:44:12,405 --> 00:44:15,820
to be Printed in
the Year MDXXV."

847
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,860
And I don't even know what the
subtitle is, but there you go.

848
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,710
If you read German,
I'm told this

849
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:25,740
is a challenge because
of the old script.

850
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:29,120
So unfoldings like this.

851
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,910
He did mostly Archimedian
solids in this book.

852
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:34,340
This book is several
hundred pages long.

853
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,290
I have a copy.

854
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:40,880
This is a
cuboctahedron unfolded.

855
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,790
He is only cutting along edges,
and he liked this, I presume,

856
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:46,790
for building models.

857
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:48,396
Here's a fancy
one, the snub cube.

858
00:44:48,396 --> 00:44:50,020
This one, I think,
might have an error.

859
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,880
A couple of them have very small
errors, but for the most part,

860
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,530
he was the inventor
of edge unfolding.

861
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:02,730
Now, he didn't ask, is this
always possible, but we did.

862
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:14,870
Mathematicians did in
1976, I believe, or '85.

863
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:21,730
'75, G. C. Shephard, geometer.

864
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:24,330
He was the first one
to write it in a paper,

865
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,890
does every convex polyhedron
have an edge unfolding?

866
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:31,410

867
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:35,500
So what can I tell you
about this problem?

868
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,960
It's hard.

869
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,535
Many people have
thought about it.

870
00:45:40,535 --> 00:45:42,160
I'm not really sure
that it's possible.

871
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,920

872
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,270
A lot of people do, though.

873
00:45:49,270 --> 00:46:04,740

874
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:08,280
It's possible for
a lot of polyhedra.

875
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,520
In fact, every polyhedron
we've tried to unfold we

876
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,600
have eventually unfolded--
convex polyhedron.

877
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:17,180
Simple set of examples are
the Archimedian solids.

878
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:20,940
Doesn't take that much effort to
find unfoldings of all of them.

879
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,810
You can do this with exhaustive
search or just playing around.

880
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:27,520
A lot of people have
done this over the years.

881
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,050
This is all the
unfoldings of those guys.

882
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:32,870
There's a lot of
heuristic software

883
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:35,180
for actually doing this.

884
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,520
I think the coolest one
right now is Pepakura.

885
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,520
If you want to build a
paper model of something,

886
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,819
you have a 3D model
thrown into Pepakura

887
00:46:42,819 --> 00:46:45,110
and it'll probably give you
a one piece unfolding, even

888
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:46,190
for non-convex shapes.

889
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:48,240
Even though it's
not always possible,

890
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,980
it'll do edge
cuttings, it'll try

891
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,040
to do some exhaustive search,
and usually does pretty well.

892
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,810
Sometimes it'll use
multiple pieces.

893
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:57,850
That's the catch.

894
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:00,170
There's a link in
the lecture notes.

895
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:03,210
The most thorough
mathematical search

896
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:08,810
is by this guy, Wolfram
Schlickenrieder,

897
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:12,540
who wrote the equivalent
of a master's thesis

898
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:19,056
in Berlin 13 years ago.

899
00:47:19,056 --> 00:47:20,680
I just wrote to him
about it yesterday.

900
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,934
I was like, hey,
this is cool stuff.

901
00:47:22,934 --> 00:47:24,100
Can I show it in my lecture?

902
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,400
He was like, yeah, it lives on.

903
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,100

904
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,670
He had a class of 10
different algorithms,

905
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:36,250
around that many,
possible algorithms

906
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:38,140
for unfolding all
convex polyhedra,

907
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:40,610
and then he came up with
a dozen different families

908
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:41,250
of polyhedra.

909
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:43,708
I don't have the polyhedra
drawn here, just the unfoldings.

910
00:47:43,708 --> 00:47:46,920

911
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,660
They're generators of
big classes of polyhedra.

912
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,940
He applied every
algorithm to every class.

913
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,400
Ideally, you get an algorithm
that works for all classes

914
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,120
or you find a class that
foils all algorithms.

915
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,580
Sadly, he found neither.

916
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:06,690
Every algorithm was
foiled by some example,

917
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:09,435
yet every example was
foiled by some algorithm.

918
00:48:09,435 --> 00:48:12,560

919
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,460
It's really annoying, but here's
some examples where they fail.

920
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:20,210
They just barely fail, just a
couple triangles are messed up.

921
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:21,780
Little squares are messed up.

922
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,820
I think these are called
the turtle polyhedra.

923
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:28,580
It's like a big, flat thing
and then a dome on top.

924
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:31,460
So inconclusive, I
guess, is the answer.

925
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:34,470
There was one algorithm that
had a degree of freedom.

926
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:36,330
You had to choose
a direction, then

927
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,100
you cut along all the edges
that are most in that direction.

928
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,480
And there was a conjecture
on the table from this thesis

929
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,070
that maybe for every
polyhedron, there

930
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:46,020
is a direction that
works, but then

931
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:49,450
that was destroyed
four years ago.

932
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:53,014
Brendan Lucier from Waterloo
proved that that's not true.

933
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:54,430
He found a polyhedron
that doesn't

934
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:56,277
work from any direction.

935
00:48:56,277 --> 00:48:58,360
So at the moment, we have
no candidate algorithms,

936
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,940
which makes me worry whether
this could possibly be true.

937
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,700

938
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,250
We have some more bad examples.

939
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:10,586
Here are some annoying things,
like a cube with a corner

940
00:49:10,586 --> 00:49:11,085
cut off.

941
00:49:11,085 --> 00:49:13,870

942
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:16,530
It's a very local thing, but
you can mess up really easily.

943
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:19,174
It's actually quite common
to mess up, I would say,

944
00:49:19,174 --> 00:49:20,840
even though for things
like Archimedian,

945
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,970
it's much harder to mess up.

946
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:27,840
Simplest polyhedron that messes
up is this sliver tetrahedron.

947
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,300
So the polyhedron
is drawn at the top.

948
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:39,150
It's a little hard to
see, but on the backside,

949
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:46,750
there's an edge like
that, if you can imagine.

950
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,550
So it's almost
flat, so that's why

951
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:52,830
it's drawn flat, and
the four corners,

952
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:55,074
like a tetrahedron
should have, four faces,

953
00:49:55,074 --> 00:49:56,740
the front two triangles
and the back two

954
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,080
triangles with the
line that I drew.

955
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:02,585
And if you unfold it in a simple
way, you just cut from a to b,

956
00:50:02,585 --> 00:50:04,740
it unfolds like
this, no problem.

957
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,840
But if you unfold
the wrong way, which

958
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,320
is to cut both of
the diagonal lines,

959
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,490
then you end up with the
spears that cross each other,

960
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:15,090
so you really have
to be careful.

961
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:21,160
In fact, if you take
a random polyhedron--

962
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,870
I choose 80 points on a
sphere, I take the convex hull.

963
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:28,100
It's a very nice, round
sphere-like polyhedron.

964
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,454
And I look at all
the unfoldings--

965
00:50:30,454 --> 00:50:32,120
this is probably not
all the unfoldings,

966
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:37,250
but I randomly generate
unfoldings, and I evaluate,

967
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:42,370
what is the observed
probability that I get overlap?

968
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:46,200
And it's very close to 100%.

969
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,150
The conjecture is that
as n goes to infinity,

970
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:51,060
the probability of
overlap goes to 1.

971
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,310
We don't have a proof of that.

972
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,956
That would be nice to prove.

973
00:50:54,956 --> 00:50:57,080
There's good reason to
believe that's easy to prove

974
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,791
or that it's true, let's
say, that there is a proof.

975
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:01,540
I don't know how to
actually formalize it.

976
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:04,810

977
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:06,950
This is some work
from the late '80s.

978
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:17,070

979
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:18,880
Just because most
unfoldings fail

980
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,780
doesn't mean there isn't
one unfolding that works.

981
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:24,780
If I were to try to prove that
there is an unfolding that

982
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:28,020
works, here's my best hope,
and it ties into some things

983
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,920
that we've seen
with tensegrities.

984
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,340
If you take a really big
polyhedron, which is the case

985
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:39,650
you worry about, and you look
at a small portion of it,

986
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:43,310
that portion will be
almost completely flat.

987
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:47,950
Locally, this thing
is mostly flat.

988
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:49,850
Instead of thinking
about the big polyhedron,

989
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:53,850
if we at least wanted to
get it to work in any patch,

990
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:59,320
think about the case of
an almost flat polyhedron.

991
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,550
So it's like a little dome.

992
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:01,962
It has boundary now.

993
00:52:01,962 --> 00:52:03,670
Makes life a little
harder, but let's say

994
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:04,930
it's a nice, convex boundary.

995
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:06,809
This is a convex dome.

996
00:52:06,809 --> 00:52:07,850
It's actually polyhedral.

997
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:12,060

998
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,670
Well, let's make it
super, super flat.

999
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:16,980
So we have this z-coordinate.

1000
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:20,364
Scale z to squash it
down into the plane.

1001
00:52:20,364 --> 00:52:21,780
What's nice about
this is then you

1002
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,740
can think of your
convex polyhedron

1003
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:28,330
just as some drawing
in the plane.

1004
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:30,720
So here maybe is my
convex polyhedron.

1005
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,240
Now, in fact, each
of these vertices

1006
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,680
is lifted a tiny amount,
some infinitesimal amount,

1007
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,070
but you can think
of it in the plane.

1008
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,657
These are convex faces.

1009
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,990
We know this thing can be
lifted to a convex polyhedron.

1010
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:45,340
That lifting is
a positive stress

1011
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,880
on all the edges except
the boundary edges.

1012
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,150
Maybe that stress gives
you some useful structure.

1013
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:52,930
If there's any hope
of this working,

1014
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:56,180
that structure better be useful,
but I don't know how to use it.

1015
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:58,140
But in particular,
open question.

1016
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,930
If I give you a super
shallow, arbitrarily

1017
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:06,040
shallow, convex polyhedral
dome, can it be unfolded?

1018
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:06,770
I don't know.

1019
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:10,790

1020
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:13,170
Maybe we'll work on it
in the problem session.

1021
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:15,926

1022
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:17,425
Haven't thought
about it for awhile.

1023
00:53:17,425 --> 00:53:20,390

1024
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:23,340
That's if you want
to solve everything.

1025
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:27,080
What if you just want to
solve some special cases?

1026
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:31,400
That is a special case
motivated by the general case.

1027
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,420
Well, you can solve the
case of a polyhedron

1028
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,630
with at most six vertices.

1029
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:38,450
That's as far as we've gotten.

1030
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:41,710
You can solve some simple
examples like pyramids

1031
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:45,880
if you take any convex
polygon, doesn't

1032
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,409
have to be irregular
or anything,

1033
00:53:47,409 --> 00:53:49,700
and then you take a point
and you take the convex hull.

1034
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,280

1035
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,860
So that's a polyhedron
and it unfolds.

1036
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,080
How does it unfold?

1037
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,350
Any suggestions where to cut?

1038
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:03,170

1039
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:05,454
How?

1040
00:54:05,454 --> 00:54:06,930
AUDIENCE: From the top?

1041
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:08,370
PROFESSOR: From the top.

1042
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,000
Yeah, just cut here.

1043
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,180
Here, we're only allowed
to cut along edges.

1044
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:16,521
This is called the
volcano unfolding.

1045
00:54:16,521 --> 00:54:17,510
What do we have?

1046
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:22,810
Like that, and then there's
just a bunch of triangles.

1047
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:24,840
What's nice about
the volcano unfolding

1048
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:30,870
is if you look at these
perpendicular strips here,

1049
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:34,100
those triangles will fit inside
those perpendicular strips,

1050
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,870
and therefore they won't
intersect each other

1051
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:38,870
because these strips don't
intersect each other.

1052
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:40,620
You could probably
even continuously bloom

1053
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:41,440
this, no problem.

1054
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,497
So a very simple example,
easy to do with volcanoes.

1055
00:54:45,497 --> 00:54:46,705
That's the so-called pyramid.

1056
00:54:46,705 --> 00:54:50,530

1057
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:55,740
Prism, a little bit more
interesting, but not by much.

1058
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:59,291
You take some polygon.

1059
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:01,510
Again, doesn't
have to be regular,

1060
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:04,804
but you take two copies of
it vertically offset, take

1061
00:55:04,804 --> 00:55:05,470
the convex hull.

1062
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:08,100

1063
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:14,010
This one you can
cut in two ways.

1064
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,420
You could do a
volcano-like thing

1065
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:19,850
where you cut all
the vertical edges

1066
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:24,360
and then you cut all but
one of the bottom edges.

1067
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:29,780
Then you'll have basically a
volcano with little rectangles

1068
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:32,920
hanging off all the sides.

1069
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:37,154
And then there's another copy,
the bottom copy of this face,

1070
00:55:37,154 --> 00:55:38,820
and it just hangs out
over here, and you

1071
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:40,590
could prove that that
won't hit anybody

1072
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:42,750
in this very simple situation.

1073
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:45,760
There's another unfolding,
though, that I mention

1074
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,580
because it's useful
for other things,

1075
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,405
and it's so-called
band unfolding.

1076
00:55:51,405 --> 00:55:57,720
Band unfolding, I
want to keep intact

1077
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:03,766
the radial band around the
thing, maybe like this.

1078
00:56:03,766 --> 00:56:07,100
What do I want to do
to keep that edge?

1079
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,950
Cut, cut.

1080
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:11,100
So I cut on all the
top edges except one,

1081
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,200
I cut on all the bottom
edges except the same one,

1082
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,610
and then I also cut
this vertical edge.

1083
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:21,060
So what I should get
is I get my top face,

1084
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:23,520
then I get a
rectangle, then I get

1085
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,520
the band that goes
around the outside,

1086
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:31,986
and then I get another copy
of my shape, the bottom side.

1087
00:56:31,986 --> 00:56:33,485
This is what we
call band unfolding.

1088
00:56:33,485 --> 00:56:36,390

1089
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:39,600
There's some nice theorems about
band unfoldings working out.

1090
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,940

1091
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:46,190
Let me get to more
interesting polyhedra.

1092
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:49,280

1093
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,150
These are some
pretty simple cases,

1094
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:54,680
but we don't know very
much on the positive side.

1095
00:56:54,680 --> 00:57:04,731

1096
00:57:04,731 --> 00:57:05,230
Prismoid.

1097
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:12,500

1098
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:19,980
Suppose you take a polygon,
and you basically inset it.

1099
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:23,900
So I want to make a new
version of the polygon

1100
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:31,600
where all of the angles match,
so these edges are parallel

1101
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,260
to each other.

1102
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:35,670
I think, actually, the
lengths can change.

1103
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:37,435
And then you take
the convex hull.

1104
00:57:37,435 --> 00:57:40,290

1105
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,665
These unfold with the
volcano unfolding.

1106
00:57:42,665 --> 00:57:45,524

1107
00:57:45,524 --> 00:57:46,940
It's a little more
subtle to prove

1108
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:49,680
but it's proved in the textbook.

1109
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:54,220

1110
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,570
Edges have to stay parallel.

1111
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:59,076
I think that might
force something.

1112
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:00,700
I'm not quite sure,
but the constraints

1113
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:01,800
are that the edges
have to be parallel

1114
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,133
and the angles have to be equal.

1115
00:58:03,133 --> 00:58:07,870

1116
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:09,160
Dome.

1117
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:12,660
Dome is actually in
some ways simpler.

1118
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:20,220
You take some base, and then
I want a whole bunch of faces

1119
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,000
that all touch the base.

1120
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,110
So in general, it's going to be
like a tree of faces, something

1121
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:28,210
like this.

1122
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:31,340
Every face has to touch
an edge of the base.

1123
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,905
These also unfold, and
also with a volcano.

1124
00:58:33,905 --> 00:58:36,560

1125
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,990
This is proved also
in the textbook.

1126
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:41,956
Both results are
by Joe O'Rourke.

1127
00:58:41,956 --> 00:58:45,150

1128
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:46,880
Prismatoid.

1129
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,370
This is the coolest
special case I'm

1130
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:52,880
going to talk about,
the most interesting.

1131
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:58,840
I take some convex polygon,
and then in a parallel offset,

1132
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:05,837
I take some other
convex polygon--

1133
00:59:05,837 --> 00:59:07,712
no relation to each
other except that they're

1134
00:59:07,712 --> 00:59:09,450
in parallel planes--
and then I take

1135
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:15,140
the convex hull,
something like that.

1136
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:21,660

1137
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,095
This one, sadly, is open.

1138
00:59:23,095 --> 00:59:26,750

1139
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,610
Now, what we do know,
and this is related

1140
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:32,160
to the band
unfolding, if you look

1141
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:38,150
at the band around the
sides of this prismatoid

1142
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:40,960
and just unfold
that by itself, that

1143
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,660
will not self intersect,
and that's quite nontrivial,

1144
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:45,320
the proof.

1145
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:48,540
But if you just
unroll the side faces,

1146
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:52,541
they will wander around but
they won't hit themselves.

1147
00:59:52,541 --> 00:59:54,040
The only remaining
problem is, where

1148
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:57,460
does the top and
the bottom face go?

1149
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:01,420
I think I have an example
where that's a little dicey.

1150
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,560
Prism.

1151
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:04,360
Prismoid.

1152
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,620
That gives you an
answer to your offset.

1153
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:09,570
So they can be sheared
away from each other,

1154
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:12,340
but this is a prismoid.

1155
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:16,920
All of the sides are parallel
and the angles match, a and b.

1156
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:22,400
Here is the volcano
unfolding of the prismoid,

1157
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,080
and here's showing that it's
not so obvious that it always

1158
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:26,580
works.

1159
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:29,830
If you're not careful where
you put the top face-- so this

1160
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:33,730
is a on top of b
in plan-- you could

1161
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:36,360
attach a to any of these faces.

1162
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,750
You have to choose
one that's not

1163
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:40,920
so inside because
it's overlapping here.

1164
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,420
But if you choose
the outermost one,

1165
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:45,390
it works and you can prove that.

1166
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:50,990
This is the dome.

1167
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:53,400
You can even have
overhang and they

1168
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,690
will unfold, volcano style.

1169
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:59,760
You no longer have those
nice perpendicular wedges

1170
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,150
to say everything is disjoined.

1171
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:02,219
But it still turns out.

1172
01:01:02,219 --> 01:01:03,010
Nothing intersects.

1173
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:05,880

1174
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,790
Here's the prismatoid
I wanted to show you.

1175
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,320
This one's actually almost flat.

1176
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:15,790
So a is this triangle right on
top of b, the triangle beneath.

1177
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:17,290
You take the convex
hull and you get

1178
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:20,470
all those edges on the outside.

1179
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:23,210
And if you're not careful--
this is more volcano

1180
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:26,245
style unfolding-- but
you can get overlap.

1181
01:01:26,245 --> 01:01:31,520

1182
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:36,410
One thing we do know,
this is kind of weird.

1183
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:40,880
If you try to go more general,
and instead of taking a convex

1184
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,470
polygon on the top and a
convex polygon on the bottom,

1185
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:45,790
instead you take a
smooth convex curve

1186
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:47,390
on the top and a
smooth convex curve

1187
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:50,094
on the bottom, which is getting
weird because now there's

1188
01:01:50,094 --> 01:01:51,510
infinitely many
vertices and going

1189
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:53,700
to be infinitely many cuts.

1190
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:57,940
But there is a natural
notion of unfolding

1191
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,490
which sort of takes
the continuum.

1192
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:02,315
You take all those lines
that go from one side

1193
01:02:02,315 --> 01:02:07,130
to the other, the rule
lines of the convex shape,

1194
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:09,147
and you just unfold them.

1195
01:02:09,147 --> 01:02:11,230
You don't actually preserve
area when you do this.

1196
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:14,080
It's not a valid unfolding
in the usual sense,

1197
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,930
but it's a natural
generalization

1198
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:18,256
of unfolding to smooth shapes.

1199
01:02:18,256 --> 01:02:20,880
You can prove, well, that part's
going to work just fine if you

1200
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,910
just volcano it, and
then you can actually

1201
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:25,920
find a place for the top face.

1202
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:33,420

1203
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,920
Those are the special
cases we know,

1204
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,280
and even some pretty simple
cases that we don't know,

1205
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,980
although it's almost there.

1206
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:54,859

1207
01:02:54,859 --> 01:02:55,775
One more open problem.

1208
01:02:55,775 --> 01:03:21,216

1209
01:03:21,216 --> 01:03:23,090
Just mention this because
it's a fun problem.

1210
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:25,930

1211
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:37,880
So again, I want to edge
unfold all convex polyhedra,

1212
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:41,209
but I allow multiple
pieces to make

1213
01:03:41,209 --> 01:03:42,375
the problem a little easier.

1214
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:45,640

1215
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:53,190
So let's say I have a
polyhedron with f faces.

1216
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:56,240
I want to know how few
pieces could I get away with?

1217
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:59,336
The big open problem is, can
I get away with one piece?

1218
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,460
What if you make it easier?

1219
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:05,260
What if I just want, say,
little o of f pieces?

1220
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:07,910
Smaller than any
constant times f.

1221
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:08,790
This is open.

1222
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:12,710

1223
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:14,890
What we do know is
some constant times

1224
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:19,210
f where the constant
is less than 1.

1225
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:22,730
Best constant I have
written here is 1/2.

1226
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:24,400
There is a better
bound, but I think

1227
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,057
it's not so easy to
summarize in this form.

1228
01:04:27,057 --> 01:04:28,640
So you can get a
little less than half

1229
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,880
the faces' number of pieces,
but that's pretty pathetic.

1230
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:35,007

1231
01:04:35,007 --> 01:04:37,340
It's a problem that seemed
like it would be a good idea,

1232
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:39,950
but so far it hasn't seemed to
make the problem much easier.

1233
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:44,170

1234
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:46,310
What do I mean by pieces?

1235
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:49,080
Well, we're all about
one piece unfolding,

1236
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:52,670
so now your cutting
can have cycles in it

1237
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:54,815
and disconnect the surface
into multiple parts.

1238
01:04:54,815 --> 01:04:55,731
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1239
01:04:55,731 --> 01:04:58,252

1240
01:04:58,252 --> 01:04:59,960
PROFESSOR: Multiple
connected components.

1241
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:14,926

1242
01:05:14,926 --> 01:05:16,550
The tricky part is
to pair up the faces

1243
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:19,550
so that everybody has a mate.

1244
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:22,010
That's not always possible.

1245
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:23,634
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

1246
01:05:23,634 --> 01:05:24,300
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1247
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:28,380
You would hope that one
third, but-- I mean,

1248
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:30,200
you can do lots of
little local arguments

1249
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:33,299
and prove this constant,
but the big question

1250
01:05:33,299 --> 01:05:34,840
is, can you get less
than a constant?

1251
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:44,230

1252
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:50,115
So last topic for today is edge
unfolding non-convex polyhedra.

1253
01:05:50,115 --> 01:05:56,470

1254
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:59,710
Sort of did that
problem addressed,

1255
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:02,830
and now this is not
always possible.

1256
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:05,700
So I want to give you a
polyhedron where you cannot

1257
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:06,410
edge unfold it.

1258
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:10,010
This is actually pretty easy,
and we did it way back in '98

1259
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:11,840
when we started
working on folding,

1260
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,310
but it's kind of cheating.

1261
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:18,130
This is a box on a box,
and the only edges here

1262
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:20,290
are the edges of the two boxes.

1263
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:22,960
There's no edges connecting
the outside of this face

1264
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,170
to the inside of that face.

1265
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:28,430
That face here is a donut.

1266
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:29,340
It's a square donut.

1267
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:32,580

1268
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:37,090
So if you're only cutting along
edges, that face is intact.

1269
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:42,600
Now I ask you, where
does the top box go?

1270
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,160
The top box has five
square faces, not six.

1271
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,990
There's nothing on the bottom.

1272
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:49,420
And somehow, it has to
be attached to the rest

1273
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:50,310
if I want one piece.

1274
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:53,670
That means that all
five faces fit in here,

1275
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:56,490
but there's only room
for one in terms of area

1276
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:58,550
so you're screwed.

1277
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:02,790
But this is cheating because
what I really wanted to do

1278
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:05,420
was generalize this
problem, edge unfolding

1279
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:07,580
of convex polyhedra.

1280
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:09,500
Now, I know they're not
going to look convex,

1281
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,740
but that thing is
really not convex.

1282
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:14,240
It's really not
convex in the sense

1283
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:18,000
that you have this face that is
not even topologically a disk.

1284
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,250
It has a hole in it.

1285
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:21,660
Convex polyhedra
don't have that.

1286
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:24,710
So in some sense, this
is a topological problem,

1287
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:27,000
you might say.

1288
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,300
And you might hope that if
I looked at polyhedra that

1289
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:33,500
are topologically
convex, maybe those

1290
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,520
would unfold by edge cuts.

1291
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,420
"Topologically convex"
means that if you just

1292
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:43,070
move the vertices around but
preserve the edge structure,

1293
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:46,009
then it becomes a
convex polyhedron.

1294
01:07:46,009 --> 01:07:48,050
In other words, I take a
convex polyhedron, which

1295
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:50,164
we think maybe has
an edge unfolding,

1296
01:07:50,164 --> 01:07:51,830
and then I just pull
the vertices around

1297
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:54,650
but preserve all the faces.

1298
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:56,570
Then can you edge unfold those?

1299
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:58,970
And the answer is no.

1300
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:02,900
I have one more example
before we get there.

1301
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:05,660
This polyhedron, at least
all the faces are disks.

1302
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:07,100
There's no holes.

1303
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:09,060
So it's a cube with
little bites taken out

1304
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:11,820
of all the edges, same paper.

1305
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:13,320
And this thing also
does not unfold.

1306
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,445
It's a little less obvious.

1307
01:08:14,445 --> 01:08:17,122

1308
01:08:17,122 --> 01:08:18,830
What's cheating about
this example is you

1309
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:21,590
have two faces, like this
purple one and the yellow one,

1310
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:24,359
that share two different edges.

1311
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:26,390
And for convex polyhedra,
two faces either

1312
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:29,149
share an edge or a
vertex or nothing,

1313
01:08:29,149 --> 01:08:33,800
but they can't reach
around and do to joins.

1314
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:39,890
Again, this is not topologically
convex, but this is.

1315
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:42,800
So this is two views
of the same thing,

1316
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:46,140
and if I take these spikes and
I just push that vertex down

1317
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:49,896
to be really close to this
triangle, this will be convex.

1318
01:08:49,896 --> 01:08:51,520
So it's just a convex
polyhedron that I

1319
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,560
pull on four of the points.

1320
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,080
Same facial structure.

1321
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:00,399
This has no edge unfolding
and we're going to prove that.

1322
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:12,330

1323
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:14,490
This example is even
stronger in that

1324
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:15,700
all the faces are triangles.

1325
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:25,060

1326
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:29,677
So what we're going to
do is take this thing.

1327
01:09:29,677 --> 01:09:31,385
It's kind of appropriate
for this season.

1328
01:09:31,385 --> 01:10:00,180

1329
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:03,190
So I've got a
tetrahedral spike on top.

1330
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:05,330
Think of that as going
out of the board.

1331
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:09,541
And then in the plane of
the board is this triangle,

1332
01:10:09,541 --> 01:10:11,040
and then I just add
in all the edges

1333
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,980
to make it a triangulation.

1334
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:14,742
Adding edges is a
worry because that's

1335
01:10:14,742 --> 01:10:16,450
where we're allowed
to cut, so you really

1336
01:10:16,450 --> 01:10:18,296
have to worry about
all those edges we add.

1337
01:10:18,296 --> 01:10:21,220
If we add them in
that way, I claim,

1338
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:24,450
you take this-- we call
it the witch's hat--

1339
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:29,190
then you multiply, in some
sense, by a tetrahedron,

1340
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:31,870
meaning I take four
copies of this hat,

1341
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:35,890
I put one on each face
of the tetrahedron,

1342
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:38,970
and you get that example.

1343
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:42,550
Here's one witch's hat and
they're just joined along edges

1344
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:44,744
to make the tetrahedron.

1345
01:10:44,744 --> 01:10:46,410
You could do this
with bigger polyhedra,

1346
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:49,300
too, like octahedron, anything
with equilateral triangles,

1347
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:51,910
but tetrahedron is the
smallest where it works.

1348
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:54,660
Just two of them glued face
to face would not work,

1349
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:56,260
but this way does work.

1350
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:57,350
Is that true?

1351
01:10:57,350 --> 01:11:01,850

1352
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:04,892
Now I've got to think about two
of them joined face to face.

1353
01:11:04,892 --> 01:11:05,850
I don't think it works.

1354
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:07,308
Otherwise, we would
have done that.

1355
01:11:07,308 --> 01:11:09,410

1356
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:11,500
Oh yes, I think I see why.

1357
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:18,880

1358
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,280
Why doesn't this work?

1359
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:25,040
I should say it doesn't work
if the spikes are really tall

1360
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:28,304
and the base is really flat.

1361
01:11:28,304 --> 01:11:29,970
I'm going to define
what "really" means,

1362
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:31,630
but we'll get there.

1363
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:36,290

1364
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:38,390
So here's our witch's hat.

1365
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:42,660

1366
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:46,930
When this spike is really
tall, these angles, alpha,

1367
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:50,100
are very close to 90,
a little bit under 90.

1368
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:54,380
This angle in the floor here--
well, this angle in the floor

1369
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:57,350
is about 60, probably
actually is exactly 60.

1370
01:11:57,350 --> 01:11:59,400
This is an equilateral triangle.

1371
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:04,220
So if this thing is very flat,
this angle will be almost 300

1372
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:06,750
because it's 360 minus 60.

1373
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:14,860
It'll be a little bit less
than 300 but almost 300.

1374
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:17,450
These matter.

1375
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:20,560
In particular, the
total sum of angles

1376
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:25,710
here is 300 plus twice
90, which is big.

1377
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:27,670
It's bigger than 360.

1378
01:12:27,670 --> 01:12:28,460
That's the point.

1379
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:32,920
In fact, 300 plus one
of these angles, 90,

1380
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:37,760
would be almost 390,
which is way above 360.

1381
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:40,491
So this has negative curvature,
and even if you cut out

1382
01:12:40,491 --> 01:12:42,240
one of the spike
triangles, it would still

1383
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,980
have negative curvature.

1384
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:48,532
That's going to be bad
news because let's just

1385
01:12:48,532 --> 01:12:49,490
imagine for the moment.

1386
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:51,105
We know unfolding
things with boundary

1387
01:12:51,105 --> 01:12:54,460
is hard, but let's pretend
for now that you wanted

1388
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:56,840
to unfold a hat in isolation.

1389
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:01,110
You wanted to unfold it into
one piece without overlap.

1390
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,980
Think about what you could do.

1391
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:08,610
I have to cut with
a spanning forest,

1392
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:11,760
I guess, meaning
it's acyclic, it's

1393
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,530
got to hit all the vertices.

1394
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:15,910
There's only four vertices here.

1395
01:13:15,910 --> 01:13:19,000
How could I hit all the
vertices with a forest?

1396
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,920
You may recall from way back
when that trees have leaves.

1397
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,960
Every tree has at
least two leaves.

1398
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,837
Here I might have multiple
trees, maybe, but unlikely,

1399
01:13:27,837 --> 01:13:29,420
and I have to have
at least to leaves.

1400
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:31,650
Where could those two leaves be?

1401
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:35,000
Could they be at any leaves
or vertices at degree one?

1402
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,972
Could they be at any of
these three vertices?

1403
01:13:37,972 --> 01:13:39,680
No, because they have
negative curvature.

1404
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,405
We know a vertex with
negative curvature

1405
01:13:41,405 --> 01:13:43,280
has to have at least
two cuts incident to it.

1406
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:46,460
You can't stop at
these three vertices.

1407
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:51,530
That only leaves one
vertex and the boundary.

1408
01:13:51,530 --> 01:13:53,010
So the only thing
you can do if you

1409
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:55,550
want to visit all the
vertices and start somewhere

1410
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:58,140
on the boundary and get
to the x, get to the peak.

1411
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:04,780

1412
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:05,850
That's all you can do.

1413
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:08,100
You couldn't have multiple
connections to the boundary

1414
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:10,280
because then you
would disconnect.

1415
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,840
Then there's really
only two choices

1416
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:15,980
and they're
reflectionally symmetric.

1417
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:17,810
And we're only allowed
to go along edges.

1418
01:14:17,810 --> 01:14:19,260
It's super constrained.

1419
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:21,370
You can go here, walk
around, and go up,

1420
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:23,809
or you can walk around
the other way and go up.

1421
01:14:23,809 --> 01:14:25,850
Those are actually slightly
different because you

1422
01:14:25,850 --> 01:14:28,780
have two choices of which
edge to follow here.

1423
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:32,740
They're both screwed
because if you

1424
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:36,040
look at this point, the
white dot, or the white dot

1425
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:40,110
up there, what remains
here on the outside

1426
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:43,730
is almost 300 degrees
of material on the base

1427
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:46,340
plus one of the 90 degree
faces, the back one

1428
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:47,410
that you can't see.

1429
01:14:47,410 --> 01:14:48,820
It's easier to see here.

1430
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:50,700
You have the 300
degrees on the bottom

1431
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:54,130
and then the white face
is still attached to it,

1432
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:56,915
and that's almost 390.

1433
01:14:56,915 --> 01:14:58,290
When you flatten
that thing, it's

1434
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:01,150
going to overlap
itself at that point.

1435
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:02,520
Bad news.

1436
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,310
So this just says, if I
look at a hat in isolation,

1437
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:08,010
it can't unfold, but that's
not what I care about.

1438
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:10,220
I care about four of
them joined together.

1439
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:16,550

1440
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:19,050
Suppose you had some
unfolding of the whole thing,

1441
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:20,790
and then I look
at, well, what cuts

1442
01:15:20,790 --> 01:15:26,590
happen within the witch's hat?

1443
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:28,864
I know the witch's hat
cannot remain in one piece.

1444
01:15:28,864 --> 01:15:30,280
Therefore, it must
be disconnected

1445
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:34,600
into multiple pieces,
something like this.

1446
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:44,550
Again, the cuts have to visit
all the vertices somehow,

1447
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:47,820
but we know from the
perspective of a single hat,

1448
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:51,090
that hat must split
into two parts.

1449
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:53,930
There are lots of things
you could consider.

1450
01:15:53,930 --> 01:15:56,800
Let's suppose this is
possible, not even worry

1451
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,040
about these kinds of pictures.

1452
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,755
Well, I claim we have a problem.

1453
01:16:01,755 --> 01:16:27,021

1454
01:16:27,021 --> 01:16:27,895
Here's a tetrahedron.

1455
01:16:27,895 --> 01:16:30,910

1456
01:16:30,910 --> 01:16:33,894
These vertices are all
the same point, actually.

1457
01:16:33,894 --> 01:16:35,310
I've just unfolded
the tetrahedron

1458
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:37,393
because it's way easier
to draw in two dimensions.

1459
01:16:37,393 --> 01:16:41,220

1460
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:46,170
So if I look at the hat
that is on this triangle,

1461
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:48,570
this hat gets disconnected
into two parts.

1462
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:50,590
There's only three
connection points

1463
01:16:50,590 --> 01:16:51,800
to the rest of the world.

1464
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,390
So what these pictures
have to look like is they

1465
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:58,766
connect two of the vertices
by a collection of cuts.

1466
01:16:58,766 --> 01:17:00,390
If you're going to
cut into two halves,

1467
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:02,880
you've got to have
a path across,

1468
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:07,650
and there's only three
vertices to visit.

1469
01:17:07,650 --> 01:17:09,526
There's some collection
of cuts that go from,

1470
01:17:09,526 --> 01:17:11,108
let's say, this
vertex to this vertex.

1471
01:17:11,108 --> 01:17:12,940
At this point,
everything's symmetric.

1472
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:16,189
Maybe it would be more obvious
if I started the center.

1473
01:17:16,189 --> 01:17:17,730
It could be from
here to there, could

1474
01:17:17,730 --> 01:17:20,271
be from here to there or from
here to there, but at least one

1475
01:17:20,271 --> 01:17:23,380
of those things exist,
and by rotational symmetry

1476
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:27,490
of this diagram,
say it's that one.

1477
01:17:27,490 --> 01:17:30,040
Well, what happens to this face?

1478
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,280
Could there be
something like this?

1479
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,670
No, because then this
would be disconnected

1480
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:37,980
from the rest of the world.

1481
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:41,220
So suddenly, this
hat is constrained.

1482
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:43,390
Maybe it could look like this.

1483
01:17:43,390 --> 01:17:44,140
You have a choice.

1484
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:45,892
It could look like
that or like that,

1485
01:17:45,892 --> 01:17:47,600
but by reflectional
symmetry, same thing.

1486
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,240
So let's say this one.

1487
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:52,600
Remember, x is the
same everywhere.

1488
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:55,780
Well, that means
this is impossible

1489
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:58,920
because this edge is
actually glued to this edge,

1490
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,940
and so then this thing
would be disconnected

1491
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:02,720
from the rest of the world.

1492
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,780
So there's a couple
of possibilities.

1493
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:08,380
It could look like this,
or it could look like this.

1494
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:11,917

1495
01:18:11,917 --> 01:18:13,500
It was one of those
two for this face.

1496
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:14,500
We've got one face left.

1497
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:17,620

1498
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:22,690
This is impossible because
this edge glues to this one,

1499
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:25,570
so imagine this thing being
picked up and moved over here.

1500
01:18:25,570 --> 01:18:28,115
So we have a wiggly line
here and then this stuff,

1501
01:18:28,115 --> 01:18:29,490
and so that would
be disconnected

1502
01:18:29,490 --> 01:18:33,160
from the rest of the world,
so that can't happen.

1503
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:36,160
What about this one?

1504
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,840
Is that the harder one?

1505
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,822
I don't know.

1506
01:18:40,822 --> 01:18:42,780
It's been a while since
I've used the argument.

1507
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:44,700
If we have this
together with this,

1508
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:47,510
that's clearly bad because
that forms a cycle.

1509
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:49,790
No good.

1510
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:51,930
But what if I have this
together with this one?

1511
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:56,877

1512
01:18:56,877 --> 01:18:57,710
It gets hard to see.

1513
01:18:57,710 --> 01:19:01,630

1514
01:19:01,630 --> 01:19:02,610
It's bad.

1515
01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:03,490
It's a cycle.

1516
01:19:03,490 --> 01:19:07,870
It starts and ends at x,
and if you fold it up right,

1517
01:19:07,870 --> 01:19:09,970
you'll see there's really
two sides to that cycle.

1518
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:13,050
It's actually forced,
so that's bad.

1519
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:18,880
All right, one more
choice, this one.

1520
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,894
If I do this together
with this one,

1521
01:19:21,894 --> 01:19:23,810
that's going to be bad
because that's a cycle.

1522
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:26,860
We start and end at x.

1523
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:29,430
What if I do this
one and that one?

1524
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:30,930
Well, that's also
bad because here's

1525
01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:33,380
a cycle that starts
at x, ends at x.

1526
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:36,040
This and this form the
inner of the cycle.

1527
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:42,095
All cases are bad,
so no edge unfolding.

1528
01:19:42,095 --> 01:19:46,460

1529
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:49,410
Tragic.

1530
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:52,180
We can think briefly about
the case-- do I have time?

1531
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:54,220
I have 10 seconds.

1532
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:56,460
About the case where
there are two triangles.

1533
01:19:56,460 --> 01:20:01,460
I guess I should
draw them like this.

1534
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:04,776
So this point is the
same as this point.

1535
01:20:04,776 --> 01:20:07,150
So if I try to simplify this,
instead of using four hats,

1536
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:09,720
I just use two hats,
put one here, one here.

1537
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:15,560
Then I could do something
like this, I think,

1538
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:20,030
and maybe that's OK if
there's no cycle formed there.

1539
01:20:20,030 --> 01:20:22,740
So we really needed the
tetrahedron somehow.

1540
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:25,580
I think it does work for
octahedron and larger also,

1541
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:29,110
but just two triangles
is not enough.

1542
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:32,375
And that is unfolding.

1543
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:36,580
We did not always edge foldable
for general polyhedra, even

1544
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:38,627
topologically convex polyhedra.

1545
01:20:38,627 --> 01:20:40,710
Next time, we'll talk more
about general unfolding

1546
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:42,940
of arbitrary polyhedra.
