1
0-1:59:59,500 --> 00:00:04,210

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,920
PROFESSOR: Let's get started.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,810
Today we're really going
to take on folding polygons

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,130
into polyhedra in a big way.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,190
We got started last time.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,890
Today we're going
to do the real thing

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,780
with some tape and scissors.

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,300

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,195
Folding polyhedra.

10
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:31,939

11
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:34,140
It's pretty much the
last kind of folding

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,450
that we're going to be
talking about in this class.

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,270
We see linkage folding, paper
folding, unfolding polyhedra,

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,430
and finally, folding polyhedra.

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,289

16
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:48,580
So this is a, sort of, problem.

17
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,994
We're given some polygon.

18
00:00:49,994 --> 00:00:52,160
We're not told where to
folder or how to glue it up,

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,330
necessarily.

20
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,470
We'd like to find,
is there some way

21
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,055
to glue this
boundary to itself--

22
00:00:59,055 --> 00:01:05,550
I've drawn this picture
before, something like this--

23
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,425
in order to make a
convex polyhedron?

24
00:01:08,425 --> 00:01:15,195

25
00:01:15,195 --> 00:01:19,080
There's several versions
of this problem.

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,405
One is the decision version,
which is, I give you a polygon.

27
00:01:23,405 --> 00:01:25,895
And I want to know, does it
make any convex polyhedron?

28
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:30,340

29
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,730
For the cross,
the answer is yes.

30
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,800
We will see examples later
today where the answer is no.

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,660
In fact, most of the
time the answer is no.

32
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:43,080

33
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:52,610
So given a polygon, can its
boundary be glued to itself?

34
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,510

35
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,850
And this is the
distinguishing feature

36
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,360
from origami is that's
all you get to do

37
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,920
and no multiple coverage.

38
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:15,320
You want exactly
that surface to be

39
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,680
folded into convex polyhedron.

40
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:37,310

41
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,080
And today's lecture is going
to be mainly about mathematics

42
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,130
for solving this problem.

43
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,080
The next class will be
algorithms for solving

44
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,810
this problem.

45
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,920
So we need some mathematical
tools, some cool geometry

46
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,672
stuff by a Russian
geometer called Alexandrov,

47
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:55,926
from the '40s.

48
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,800
And that's what we'll
be talking about today.

49
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,258
Then we'll see how that turns
into an algorithm next class.

50
00:03:00,258 --> 00:03:06,600

51
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,810
Decision is nice.

52
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,990
But of course, we'd like to
actually find these gluings.

53
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,450
I want to actually know that
this guy folds into a cube.

54
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,360
So there's the
enumeration problem,

55
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,060
which is list all the
gluings and all the foldings.

56
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:31,660

57
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,610
And there's also the more
mathematical combinatorial

58
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:42,850
problem, which is,
how many can there be?

59
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:53,460

60
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,770
And we'll start
addressing that today

61
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,230
by showing that there
can be infinitely many.

62
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,390
There can be continua.

63
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,460
For example, this
polygon, this rectangle,

64
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,180
can fold into infinitely
many polyhedra.

65
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,110
We'll prove that today.

66
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,330
We won't do all of them.

67
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,260
But we'll one of them, I guess.

68
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,130
So that's makes this listing
all of them a little bit

69
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,810
difficult, when there's
infinitely many.

70
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,240
But it turns out they'll
fall into some nice classes.

71
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,656
We'll be able to
characterize that

72
00:04:24,656 --> 00:04:26,166
at the end of today's class.

73
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,040
And so this problem is
actually well defined.

74
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,280
They're a finite number
of distinct classes.

75
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,922
And you could list them all.

76
00:04:33,922 --> 00:04:35,380
There can actually
be exponentially

77
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,470
many of those classes.

78
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,110
But most the time,
it's polynomial.

79
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,760
That'll be more next class.

80
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,970
These are the sorts of problems
we're interested in folding.

81
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,770
Now, one natural
question is, why am I

82
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,740
restricting myself to convex?

83
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,990
And one answer is, well,
that's where most of the work

84
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,870
has been done.

85
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,030
But there is some nice
work on the nonconvex case.

86
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,280
So let me tell you about that.

87
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,590

88
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:08,286
So for nonconvex-- or
where you don't care about

89
00:05:08,286 --> 00:05:09,910
whether the result
is convex-- you just

90
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,920
want it to make some polyhedron.

91
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,925
You can show it's
always possible.

92
00:05:14,925 --> 00:05:20,160

93
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,540
What this means is if
I'm given some polygon,

94
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,400
and I glue up the
boundary somehow--

95
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,890
and this result
even holds if you

96
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,910
don't glue up all
of the boundary.

97
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,750
Because then we're no longer
trying to make a convex thing.

98
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,100
For example, I could
glue up all the boundary,

99
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,010
as long as the way that I glue
things is orientable-- I don't

100
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:43,890
put twists in an unresolvable
way, in these gluings--

101
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,090
then you're golden.

102
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:58,375
So you need that the surface
is orientable or has boundary.

103
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:06,200

104
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,360
So this is posed as an
open problem in our book.

105
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,240
And then we
discovered, this year,

106
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,880
that it was already solved
in 1960, but in Russian.

107
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,990
And then, it was only
translated in 1996.

108
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,860
We still should have
known about it in '96.

109
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,141
But we finally
realized that they

110
00:06:25,141 --> 00:06:26,640
didn't talk about
folding or gluing.

111
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,350
They were talking about
realizing polyhedral metrics,

112
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,710
which is the language we're
going to translate to soon.

113
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:37,180
But our bad.

114
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,260
And I think this is a
pretty complicated result.

115
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,968
So we're not going to
talk about it here.

116
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,255
But it's interesting.

117
00:06:42,255 --> 00:06:44,700
I'd like to learn more about it.

118
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,840
So it's by Burago
and Zalgaller, I've

119
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,410
used others of their theorems.

120
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,850
So it's funny I
didn't know this one.

121
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,730
In some sense, the
decision question

122
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,690
isn't interesting for
non-convex polyhedra.

123
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,334
So by restricting
the convex, saying,

124
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:02,750
I want to make
convex shapes, this

125
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,041
becomes an interesting problem.

126
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,700
And it leads to lots of cool
mathematics and algorithms.

127
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,080
And that's what we're
going to talk about.

128
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,180
So I want to talk about
this guy, Alexandrov.

129
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,070

130
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,880
Not really the guy, but the
mathematics that he did.

131
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,630
And we're going to appropriate
his name a little bit

132
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,794
and talk about
Alexandrov gluings.

133
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:28,960
This is a term that we made
up, obviously he didn't.

134
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,543
You don't usually make up your
own terms named after yourself.

135
00:07:31,543 --> 00:07:34,850

136
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,144
We'd like to know which
gluings are valid.

137
00:07:37,144 --> 00:07:39,560
We're not going to think about
where the thing is creased,

138
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,520
how to fold.

139
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,230
We're just going to focus
on the gluing for now.

140
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,290
What makes a gluing valid?

141
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,670
Well, one thing that we
talked about last time

142
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,710
is that once you have a
gluing, in this picture,

143
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,550
you can compute shortest paths.

144
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,510
You can compute the shortest
path from this vertex

145
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,309
to this vertex.

146
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,600
But here, it's a straight line.

147
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,016
There's probably
another path that

148
00:07:59,016 --> 00:08:00,710
goes around a different way.

149
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,100
Last time we did the shortest
path from here to here.

150
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,382
And it was some
complicated thing.

151
00:08:05,382 --> 00:08:08,044
I won't try to do it again.

152
00:08:08,044 --> 00:08:09,460
But you can compute
shortest paths

153
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,780
once you know what's
connected to what.

154
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,020
So this defines what
we call a metric.

155
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,270
We're going to learn
something about that.

156
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:29,320
Polygon plus gluing
induce a metric.

157
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,364
Metric just means it tells you
how far different points are

158
00:08:32,364 --> 00:08:33,030
from each other.

159
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,860

160
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,350
And we can compute that metric
by computing shortest paths.

161
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:43,330

162
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,330
I'm going to start
abstracting a little bit away

163
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,570
from polygon plus gluing
and just think about,

164
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,960
there's some surface
that, in your mind,

165
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,192
it's not really
geometric thing entirely.

166
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:54,900
But locally, you
understand the geometry.

167
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,040
If you're at some
corner, you can

168
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,910
understand what other
vertices are near to you

169
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,650
and how to walk around
on that surface.

170
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,300
So locally, you understand the
metric and how it's laid out.

171
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,250
When you're at this
corner, you know--

172
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,810
and let's say I glued this to
this-- that your curvature is

173
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,790
90 degrees, that there's 270
degrees of material there.

174
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,750
And you could go any one of
those 270 degrees of directions

175
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,910
from there.

176
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,900
So that's the sense in
which we have a metric.

177
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,180
Now, there are three things
that this metric should satisfy

178
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,489
if we want to make
something that's convex.

179
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:32,155
Any suggestions?

180
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:37,740

181
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,767
AUDIENCE: Less than
or equal to 360.

182
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:42,100
PROFESSOR: Less than or equal
to 360 degrees of material

183
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,641
an any point.

184
00:09:42,641 --> 00:09:46,230
Yep, that is what we
would call convexity.

185
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:55,500

186
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,970
It's really a local convexity.

187
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,410

188
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:07,290
All points have 0 or
positive curvature.

189
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,540
That's the way I would say it.

190
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,880
Remember, curvature
was 360 minus some

191
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,047
of the angles at the vertex.

192
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,546
So this is the same as saying
you have, at most, 360 degrees

193
00:10:17,546 --> 00:10:18,470
of material any point.

194
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,220
This is obviously necessary.

195
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,401
And the point is, you can
evaluate this just knowing

196
00:10:22,401 --> 00:10:23,650
how things are glued together.

197
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,850
You don't need to
understand 3D geometry.

198
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,367
It's a local property.

199
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:28,950
And certainly necessary
if we're going

200
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:32,180
to try to make a
convex polyhedron.

201
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:32,980
Anything else?

202
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:39,450

203
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,259
They get less obvious
from here, I guess.

204
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:47,074

205
00:10:47,074 --> 00:10:47,740
Any topologists?

206
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:55,835

207
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:57,300
AUDIENCE: You
shouldn't have holes.

208
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,560
PROFESSOR: Shouldn't have holes.

209
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,059
Right.

210
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:02,570
So I should definitely
glue everything together.

211
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,360
It's sort of implicit
in this statement

212
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,800
but not totally explicit.

213
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,385
And there's a little
more than that.

214
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:11,260
Not only should everything
to glued together,

215
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:17,480
but for example, if I glued
this edge to this edge

216
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,910
and I glued this edge to this
edge-- something like that.

217
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,300
That's probably not
going to work out.

218
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,050
Crossings are bad.

219
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,060
And what's really going
wrong there is the topology.

220
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,310
If we're trying to make
something that's convex,

221
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,560
it better be
topologically a sphere.

222
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,140
So that's the third condition.

223
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:45,836

224
00:11:45,836 --> 00:11:47,210
And this is, again,
something you

225
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:52,265
can figure out just by
looking at the local metric.

226
00:11:52,265 --> 00:12:01,136

227
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:02,510
This is a property
about metrics.

228
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,170
In their case of
polygons plus gluings,

229
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,680
it's really easy
to figure out when

230
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,089
this is the case, which is that
the gluing should be complete,

231
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:10,880
as you were saying.

232
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,670
You shouldn't leave
anything blank.

233
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,990
Everything gets
glued to something.

234
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,960
And it has no
crossings that will

235
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,452
be equivalent to being
sphere like, in our case.

236
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,160
The other property
actually always holds.

237
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,060
So it's no surprise that
you didn't think of it.

238
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,930

239
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,250
But if you want to think
a little more generally,

240
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,050
this a key property we're
using that we started

241
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:43,240
from a polygon, not some
smooth curve thing, which

242
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:49,880
is that only a finite number of
points have nonzero curvature.

243
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:55,400

244
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,650
If we want to make a polyhedron
with a finite a number

245
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,300
vertices, well,
these are going to be

246
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,990
the vertices, all the points
with nonzero curvature.

247
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,230
So there had better be a
finite number of those.

248
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,470
Now, when we start with
a polygon and just glue

249
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,720
some finite set of
segments to each other,

250
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,780
that will happen automatically.

251
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,290
But it's a property we're using.

252
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,520
So these three
properties together

253
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,840
are what I'm going to
call Alexandrov gluing.

254
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:27,700
If you satisfy all three of
these, you are Alexandrov.

255
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,450
And now, we have a cool
theorem about Alexandrov

256
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,600
gluings is called
Alexandrov's Theorem.

257
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,660

258
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,150
He had a lot of gluings,
but this the one

259
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,820
we use a lot in this field.

260
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:50,490

261
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:54,310
Originally proved
in 1941, I believe.

262
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:58,870
Then finally, his big
book about convex surfaces

263
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,620
was translated to English
in 2005, pretty recent.

264
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,620
But we've been reading other
translations, and so on,

265
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,020
to understand this theorem.

266
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:23,400

267
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,510
I guess I'm not using
Alexandrov gluing here.

268
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,760
But we have a
convex, polyhedral,

269
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,270
and topologically sphere.

270
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:41,660

271
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,990
Take any one of those things.

272
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:50,340
Then it's realized by a
unique convex polyhedron.

273
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:58,400

274
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,990
So this is basically the answer.

275
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,650
And from our perspective, it's
like , yeah, yeah, polyhedral.

276
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,594
Yeah, no crossings.

277
00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:06,010
But really, the
central constraint

278
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,510
that we have to worry
about is convexity,

279
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,310
that we never glue
together too much material.

280
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,140
As long as you don't glue
together more than 360 degrees

281
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,130
material at any
point, then that thing

282
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,055
will realize a unique
convex polyhedron.

283
00:15:19,055 --> 00:15:22,210

284
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,444
It's pretty cool but surprising.

285
00:15:24,444 --> 00:15:26,110
The uniqueness should
not be surprising,

286
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,400
because we proved
that last class.

287
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,070
I can remind you briefly.

288
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,570
We proved Cauchy's
Rigidity Theorem,

289
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,070
which is not quite the same.

290
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,324
And then we said, oh, yeah, if
you have some convex polyhedron

291
00:15:37,324 --> 00:15:38,740
metric, you don't
know necessarily

292
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,990
know what it looks like in 3D.

293
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,590
But you can compute
all shortest paths

294
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,570
from every vertex to
every other vertex.

295
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,210
And then however you
try to fold that thing,

296
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,810
every edge is a shortest path.

297
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:53,130
That's just a fact
about polyhedra.

298
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,990
The edges must be some subset
of these shortest paths.

299
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,844
So you think of this
as a convex polyhedron.

300
00:16:00,844 --> 00:16:02,260
And then Cauchy's
Rigidity Theorem

301
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,970
says, there's only
one convex realization

302
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,500
of that thing with those edges.

303
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,190
And Cauchy allows some of the
edges to be flat like this.

304
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,810
So there will only be one
way to embed that in 3D--

305
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,199
at most one way.

306
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,990
The surprising thing
is that there actually

307
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:21,240
is one way that you can
realize-- I'm just thinking

308
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,830
totally locally in
this kind of gluing--

309
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,090
and yet, as long as
I don't glue together

310
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:31,100
too much material at any point,
I get a convex polyhedron.

311
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,060
With the usual gluing here,
without these crossings,

312
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,445
I get a cube.

313
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:38,170
No surprise, and it's unique.

314
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,420
But there are other ways
to glue this polygon.

315
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,170
We saw them, actually,
in Lecture 1--

316
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,939
I'll show them
again next class--

317
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:45,480
that can make other
convex polyhedra.

318
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,410

319
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:55,680
Let me give you a little
idea of the proof.

320
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,960
This is going to be a
pretty high-level sketch.

321
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,510
But I'll tell you the
combinatorial part.

322
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,710
And then there's the
topology analysis part

323
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,210
that's a little less obvious.

324
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:15,180

325
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,780
We've already proved uniqueness.

326
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,670
I want to look at existence.

327
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:23,630
And we're going to use induction
on the number of vertices.

328
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,410

329
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,720
And remember, vertices
are well defined.

330
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,140
When I say vertex
here, I really mean

331
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,407
point of nonzero curvature.

332
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:36,990
We know there's
finitely many of them.

333
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,730
Call the number n.

334
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,850
And we're going to try to
simplify our polyhedron

335
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,520
and reduce the number vertices.

336
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,130
But there's lots of ways
to do that with polyhedra.

337
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,960
But here, we don't
have a polyhedron.

338
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,740
We have this kind of abstract
polyhedron in Never Never Land.

339
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,320
We know how to walk around
on the surface, locally.

340
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,680
But we don't really
know any 3D geometry.

341
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,510
So is this a crazy idea.

342
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,530
Before we get to
the crazy idea, I

343
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:13,510
need an important fact, which
is total curvature, if you

344
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:22,190
sum over all vertices,
is 720 degrees.

345
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,060

346
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,370
This is actually true, even
of nonconvex polyhedra,

347
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,920
as long as you have something
homeomorphic to a sphere,

348
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,580
topologically a sphere.

349
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,607
Total curvature is 720.

350
00:18:34,607 --> 00:18:36,940
This is actually why it's
useful to talk about curvature

351
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,810
and not how much angle is
coming together at a point.

352
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,440
So obviously, we've got zillions
of points with a curvature 0.

353
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,830
Those don't count for anything.

354
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,730
But then, somehow this thing
has to wrap around a sphere.

355
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,160
And you can compute the
curvature of a sphere at 720.

356
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,152
And this has to match that.

357
00:18:54,152 --> 00:18:57,786
I can't give a lot of intuition
for this, but it's true.

358
00:18:57,786 --> 00:18:59,915
And it's kind of powerful.

359
00:18:59,915 --> 00:19:03,090

360
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,090
It says you can't have
very many sharp vertices.

361
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:09,620
If I have a super-sharp point
in my convex polyhedron,

362
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,620
it has a curvature close to 360.

363
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,500
It's going to be
260 minus almost 0.

364
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,920
I can only have two of
those in any polyhedron.

365
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,550
Now, with a
nonconvex polyhedron,

366
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,440
I can have negative
curvature to compensate.

367
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,240
And so then, I can have lots
of spikes, like an our witch's

368
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,810
hats, where we had four spikes.

369
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,614
But for convex, I don't
have any negative numbers

370
00:19:30,614 --> 00:19:32,530
to compensate with these
big positive numbers.

371
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,690
So I can only have two spikes.

372
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,390
We're going to use that
a lot today, this fact.

373
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,577
It's called Descartes Theorem.

374
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:41,910
You may have heard of Descartes.

375
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,429

376
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:45,970
Nowadays, you prove
it in other ways.

377
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,594
But we're not going
to look at a proof.

378
00:19:47,594 --> 00:19:49,342
We're just going to use it.

379
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:51,300
I'm also going to assume
that my polyhedron has

380
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,430
at least five vertices.

381
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:57,330
Or really, my polyhedral metric
has at least five vertices.

382
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,800
If it has at least
five vertices,

383
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,880
in other words,
more than four, then

384
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,880
there will be some vertex
that has less than a quarter

385
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,130
of 720 curvature, in
fact, two of them.

386
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:13,700

387
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:22,500
Two vertices-- and I call
them x and y-- have curvature.

388
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,688

389
00:20:26,688 --> 00:20:31,400
Call them alpha and
beta, less than 180,

390
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,240
which is one quarter of 720.

391
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,550
The average is obviously
going down as n goes up.

392
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:42,440
So when n is 5, I can get two
reasonably small curvature

393
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,477
vertices.

394
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,560
This is like saying, there's
more than 180 degrees

395
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,240
of material glued at
these two points So what?

396
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,080
Well, now I'm going
to do some surgery,

397
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,110
as topologists call it.

398
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:04,524
I have these vertices, x and
y, in this sphere-like thing.

399
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:06,190
There's some shortest
path between them.

400
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,825
I can compute that.

401
00:21:07,825 --> 00:21:09,200
And now we're
saying that there's

402
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,550
a fair amount of material here
and a fair amount of material

403
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,080
here.

404
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,020
What I'd like to do is
slice the surface open along

405
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,270
that shortest path.

406
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:21,100
I've drawn it twice,
because I've cut it open.

407
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,870
There's surface here, surface
here, and a hole there.

408
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:27,610
And I'm going to glue
in some more material.

409
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:32,510
And I'm going to
glue in a triangle--

410
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,690
actually, two triangles
right on top of each other.

411
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,970
So that here, the edges
are glued together.

412
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:42,260
Back here, the edges are glued
together, here, they're not.

413
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,960
So you can see, this is
still topologically a sphere.

414
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,420
As you walk on to this edge,
you end up on the top triangle.

415
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,170
I can go around the back
to the bottom triangle.

416
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,910
And eventually, I will
get to the back edge.

417
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,686
And then I can walk like that.

418
00:21:56,686 --> 00:21:58,060
Shortest paths
are not preserved.

419
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,230
But it's at least still
topologically a sphere.

420
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:04,540
I've slipped this open,
wedged in two triangles.

421
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,480
I get a new metric.

422
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,320
Now, I get to choose
what triangles I glue in.

423
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,230
And I'm going to
set these angles.

424
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,270
Ultimately, I'd like
this angle to be

425
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:26,340
alpha over 2 and this
angle to be beta over 2.

426
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,450
Remember, curvature is 360 minus
the sum of the angles there.

427
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,940
That means that's how
much extra material

428
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,190
you need to stick in
until that vertex is flat.

429
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,760
So if I stick in an
angle of alpha over 2

430
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,920
here, at this point, and
there's two copies of it.

431
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,580
Because there's the front
triangle and the back triangle,

432
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,080
Then I'll be wedging
in alpha, which

433
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,510
is exactly what it
takes to make x flat.

434
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,860
And this is exactly what
it takes to make y flat.

435
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,721
The result will be
I'd obliterate x.

436
00:22:55,721 --> 00:22:56,720
It's no longer a vertex.

437
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,345
I obliterate y.

438
00:22:57,345 --> 00:22:58,370
It's no longer a vertex.

439
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,520
But I add this new vertex, z.

440
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,740

441
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,170
In that way, I remove
two vertices, add one,

442
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,690
which decreases n.

443
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,710
And then I can use induction.

444
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,850
Now, there's lots of things
to say why this works.

445
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,640
But this is the crazy idea.

446
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,964
It's the Alexandrov
induction, and it's useful.

447
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:19,380
If you want to
prove, for example,

448
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,300
that the star unfolding
doesn't overlap,

449
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,535
you use this induction also.

450
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:23,941
It's the only
proof that's known.

451
00:23:23,941 --> 00:23:27,090

452
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:31,040
So why did we need
these properties?

453
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,676
Well, the biggest
triangle you could make,

454
00:23:33,676 --> 00:23:35,050
something like
this, like we were

455
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,300
doing in witch's hats,
where this is almost 90.

456
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,970
This is almost 90.

457
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,930
This is x and y.

458
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,170

459
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,690
The biggest we can make
alpha over 2 is almost 90.

460
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,400
And the biggest we can make
beta over 2 is almost 90.

461
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,940
So we'd really like alpha
and beta to be less than 180.

462
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,160
But then there is a valid
triangle that does this.

463
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,630
Once you fix two angles, it of
course determines third one.

464
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,570
It might be very close to 0.

465
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,760
So z might have very large
curvature, but that's OK.

466
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,540

467
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,080
What else?

468
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,980
The other thing is, in what
sense could you induct?

469
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,200
And this is where I'm going
to be a little hand wavy.

470
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,730
Yeah, I've found some
other polyhedral metric.

471
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,380
It has one fewer vertex.

472
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,460
So by induction I know that
it's realized by a unique convex

473
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,540
polyhedron.

474
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,500
The how in the world
would I convert that

475
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,360
into a realization of
the original polyhedron?

476
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,760
And the answer is
continuity and magic.

477
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,319
The continuity is easy to see.

478
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,860
When I glue in this
triangle, I don't

479
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,660
have to just glue
in the triangle

480
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,310
with those final angles.

481
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:47,470
I could actually glue in a
very tiny triangle initially.

482
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:50,116
And I could change these
angles continuously.

483
00:24:50,116 --> 00:24:51,740
That makes me feel
a little bit better.

484
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,150
I start with something
that's very, very

485
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,108
close to my polyhedron.

486
00:24:54,108 --> 00:24:55,720
Obviously, If I
could realize that,

487
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,667
I could still realize
the original, right?

488
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:59,916
It's almost the same, if I
glue in a tiny, tiny sliver

489
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,350
of a triangle.

490
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,530
That's not obvious,
but it's true.

491
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:06,990
And you vary it until the
point, where you actually

492
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,570
get something with
one fewer vertex.

493
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,195
Then you actually do
get a realization.

494
00:25:10,195 --> 00:25:14,570
And then you continuously
morph it back to your original.

495
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,304
That's the idea.

496
00:25:16,304 --> 00:25:17,720
I'm not going to
detail that idea.

497
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,010
It uses something called the
inverse function theorem, which

498
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:27,750
is a cool theorem
in real analysis.

499
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,190
But I think most of you
haven't had real analysis.

500
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,360
So you can read about
it if you're interested.

501
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,920
It's cool.

502
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,850
The main consequence
for us algorithms

503
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,640
people is that it's
non constructive.

504
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,484
It doesn't actually
tell you how to do this.

505
00:25:41,484 --> 00:25:42,900
It just says, well,
by continuity,

506
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,584
it really ought to
work out somehow.

507
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:46,500
But we don't know how.

508
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,610
We've tried to make it
work out and failed.

509
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:54,291
While this does sort of prove
the theorem by continuity,

510
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:55,790
it doesn't actually
give us any idea

511
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:59,110
of how to find what
polyhedron we are realizing,

512
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,810
which is a bit frustrating.

513
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,280
And that was the state of
the art until four years ago.

514
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:14,350

515
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:21,390
Four years ago, these guys,
Bobenko and Izmestiev,

516
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:24,700
came up with a
constructive version

517
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,860
of Alexandrov's Theorem.

518
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,520

519
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,360
And I just want to sketch
an idea of how this works.

520
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:40,910
But the end consequence, which
is done in this class, I think,

521
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,150
as a class project
three years ago,

522
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,680
is that you get a pseudo
polynomial algorithm

523
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,660
for solving this problem.

524
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,520
So I'll jump ahead a little bit.

525
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,530

526
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,840
Running time, we
get-- this, again,

527
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:05,495
for amusement value-- 1891.

528
00:27:05,495 --> 00:27:06,460
It's a good year.

529
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:15,790

530
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:19,830
I think I said, last time, that
n to the 125 times r to the 41

531
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,560
was my record.

532
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,960
Well, it's been surpassed.

533
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,400
I just forgot about it.

534
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,350
n to the 456.5 times r to the
1891, over epsilon epsilon.

535
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:33,150
Here is the desired error.

536
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,240
So you can make the error
as small as you want.

537
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,160
We can't do it perfectly.

538
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,970
But your running time increases
as the error goes down.

539
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,730
This is our usual feature size.

540
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:50,890
It's the longest length in
your input metric, let's say,

541
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:53,760
divided by the shortest length.

542
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,510
So that's a measure of how
tight the features are.

543
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,730
We had that before with
carpenter's rule stuff.

544
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:03,670
And n is the number vertices.

545
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:06,264
Obviously, this is
a very bad bound.

546
00:28:06,264 --> 00:28:07,930
But the point is it's
pseudo polynomial.

547
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,810
It's a bad bound
for the same reason

548
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,140
that our last giant ginormous
bound was ginormous.

549
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,800
Because differential flow is
hard to get good bounds on.

550
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,764
See it's possible to
get some kind of bound.

551
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:21,430
But they don't usually represent
how fast the algorithm actually

552
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:21,930
is.

553
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,264
Again, this algorithm
is pretty practical.

554
00:28:24,264 --> 00:28:25,430
There's an implementational.

555
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,190
I'll show it to you in a moment.

556
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,765
Maybe I'll show it
to you right now.

557
00:28:28,765 --> 00:28:32,030
It'll be more fun.

558
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,130
It is available on
the web for free.

559
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,010
Try it out.

560
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:41,231
I assume this is a student
of Bobenko and Izmestiev

561
00:28:41,231 --> 00:28:46,900
in Berlin, and he implemented
this program, Java.

562
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,000
So you specify a
polyhedral metric.

563
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,826
Now, that's the tricky part.

564
00:28:51,826 --> 00:28:53,200
And especially,
it's tricky here,

565
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,730
because it has to
be triangulated.

566
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,430
But we would normally
do it by specifying

567
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,162
a polygon plus a gluing.

568
00:29:00,162 --> 00:29:02,120
But of course, by computing
all shortest paths,

569
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,070
you can eventually make that
a nice triangulated thing.

570
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,750
So here I have a very simple
triangulated thing, namely,

571
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,160
a complete graph on
four vertices, which

572
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,780
makes a regular tetrahedron.

573
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,080
It doesn't look so
regular, because I

574
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,730
have a lot of perspective in
a small, narrow angle of view.

575
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:22,340
But that is a regular
tetrahedron, believe me.

576
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,960
Then I can change
the edge lengths.

577
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,570
Right now, they're
all one, so I should

578
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:32,970
be able to make one of
the edges longer, like 2.

579
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:33,870
I haven't tried this.

580
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,828
We'll see what happens.

581
00:29:34,828 --> 00:29:40,900
I say, Compute, and it says,
Starting Calculations--

582
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:45,380
not my intended answer.

583
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,880
I like it to finish
the calculation.

584
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,374

585
00:29:49,374 --> 00:29:51,165
That's why it prepared
some other examples.

586
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:54,710

587
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,450
I suspect it's not
the program failing,

588
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:59,805
but I've had some trouble
running it on this computer.

589
00:29:59,805 --> 00:30:06,710

590
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,660
I think we have demo effect.

591
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,490
Finally, something
failed in this class.

592
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,392
It took a long time.

593
00:30:12,392 --> 00:30:13,600
You'll have to try it online.

594
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,640
You can change the edge lengths
to all sorts of crazy things.

595
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,860
If you have very close
to degenerate situations,

596
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,244
it does tend to fail.

597
00:30:20,244 --> 00:30:21,660
Because there's
some tricky issues

598
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,874
to deal with and
this floating point.

599
00:30:24,874 --> 00:30:26,290
Oops, it might be
doing something.

600
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:32,320

601
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,690
Dare I try to open a file?

602
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:38,260

603
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,530
Here, you get to see my
organizational structure

604
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:42,210
or lack thereof.

605
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:51,570
Courses, Slides, 15,
and let's take Cube.

606
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,895
Exciting.

607
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:53,520
This is a cube.

608
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,630
It's not so obvious
that it is a cube.

609
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,550
But you set the edge links.

610
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:02,410
And a lot of these
are sort of diagonals.

611
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:05,720
And if I do it right,
maybe add some iterations.

612
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,064

613
00:31:08,064 --> 00:31:09,980
It says, [INAUDIBLE]
successfully constructed.

614
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:13,040
You can see it, right?

615
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,352
My job is failing, I'm afraid.

616
00:31:15,352 --> 00:31:16,060
Sorry about that.

617
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:19,979

618
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:20,479
Go away.

619
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:23,350

620
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,600
You'll have to try it at home.

621
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,040
AUDIENCE: It was there.

622
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,740
PROFESSOR: It was there?

623
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,240
Oh.

624
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,230
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

625
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:32,440
PROFESSOR: Wait, I
don't see a cube.

626
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,690
What did you see?

627
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:36,670
AUDIENCE: It was there.

628
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,669
PROFESSOR: It was there.

629
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:39,540
All right, you saw it.

630
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,450
It's like it ghost.

631
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:43,030
It's the left over
from Halloween.

632
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,120
Let me tell you a little
bit about how this works.

633
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,070
And you'll have to try
the program at home.

634
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:53,530

635
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:56,000
A crazy idea is we have
this polyhedron, which

636
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,200
we want to find.

637
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,460
It's a surface.

638
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,580
It's hard to think about
surfaces that live in 3D.

639
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,030
So I want to make it
more three dimensional.

640
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,470
And the way I
going to do that is

641
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:10,220
by thinking about the
inside of the polyhedron.

642
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,527
And say, well,
imagine it's convex.

643
00:32:12,527 --> 00:32:14,360
So there's some point
inside the polyhedron.

644
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,790
Start with one point.

645
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:18,430
And then, I'd like to fill
the interior in between.

646
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:21,637
So the surface, as you saw--
we're assuming that everything

647
00:32:21,637 --> 00:32:22,720
is initially triangulated.

648
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,332
We can do that by
adding shortest paths.

649
00:32:25,332 --> 00:32:27,040
Well, if this triangle
is on the surface,

650
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,460
and this point is in the
center, the natural thing to do

651
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,360
is to make tetrahedra inside.

652
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,680

653
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,260
If I could find
the 3D triangles,

654
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,430
I could also find
the 3D tetrahedra.

655
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,050
So we're going to
do a harder job

656
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,277
of finding the 3D tetrahedra.

657
00:32:44,277 --> 00:32:46,110
From that, we will
derive what the triangles

658
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:48,320
are-- easy enough idea.

659
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,650
Make your problem harder.

660
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,000
That often makes things easier.

661
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,190

662
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,350
How do we do that?

663
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,940
Well, for every
vertex up here-- call

664
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,500
it vi-- there's some distance.

665
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,240
This dashed line-- we're
going to call that ri.

666
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,350
That's really what we'd
like to figure out.

667
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:10,030
We already know the triangles--
we know their geometry.

668
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,370
That's given to us as
part of the metric.

669
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:14,162
We don't know how the
triangles are hinged,

670
00:33:14,162 --> 00:33:15,286
with respect to each other.

671
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:16,540
That's the dihedral angles.

672
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,820
That's the tricky part.

673
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,861
But we're not going to
worry about that directly.

674
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:23,030
We're going to think about
these edge lengths, ri.

675
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:27,070
Because if I knew
all the ri lengths--

676
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:30,471
they're the sort of radii
from the center point-- then

677
00:33:30,471 --> 00:33:32,470
I'd know all the edge
lengths of the tetrahedron

678
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,189
that uniquely determined
the tetrahedron.

679
00:33:34,189 --> 00:33:35,730
If I do that for
all the tetrahedron,

680
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,320
there would be a unique
way to glue them together.

681
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,550
And I would get the answer.

682
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,000
So I really just
need these ri's.

683
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,610

684
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,160
What I'd like to
do is characterize,

685
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,630
when are the ri's valid?

686
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:52,730
And there's a few conditions
to make them reasonable.

687
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,110
The first thing, I guess I
didn't even write in the notes.

688
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:59,050
You might call it
sanity, which is

689
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:04,645
that these are
real 3D tetrahedra.

690
00:34:04,645 --> 00:34:07,639

691
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:10,060
I'm not going to try to
characterize when that's true.

692
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,130
It's some function on the ri
lengths and existing lengths.

693
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,760
But I always want these to
correspond actual tetrahedra.

694
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,810
The trouble is, they might
not fit together right

695
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,210
to make 3D polyhedron.

696
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:22,130
So I won't really have to
worry about this condition.

697
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:27,754
The next condition-- what
do I call it-- is convexity.

698
00:34:27,754 --> 00:34:32,330

699
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,050
This will also be kind of easy.

700
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:38,270
What I want is that the
outside surface is convex.

701
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:42,120
Now, if you look at the outside
surface, what we really want

702
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,310
is that one of these edges,
on the outside surface,

703
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,670
bends the correct way.

704
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,837
So when will that be true?

705
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:49,670
Well, I'm going to look
at the two triangles

706
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,050
next to that edge.

707
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:58,374
That defines two tetrahedra
that share a face.

708
00:34:58,374 --> 00:34:59,790
And if I knew what
the ri's where,

709
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,520
I'd know what those
tetrahedra are.

710
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,790
And what I really need is
that if I look at the angle--

711
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,790
I'm going to draw this
a little bit thicker--

712
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:11,660
this dihedral angle
between-- it's hard to draw.

713
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,340
If you look at
this edge, there's

714
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,190
two tetrahedra glued there.

715
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,710
So there's some
solid dihedral angle

716
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,260
of tetrahedron glued at that
edge from this tetrahedron.

717
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,120
And there's some
angle over here that's

718
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,150
glued to this edge
from that tetrahedron.

719
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:29,250
I want the sum of those
two dihedral angles,

720
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:34,600
the total material there, to
be less than or equal to 180.

721
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,670
That is, the sum of
those angles is really

722
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,680
the dihedral angle
along this edge.

723
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,370
If it's less than
180, it'll be convex.

724
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:45,440
It's hard to draw,
but very intuitive.

725
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,360
This is also pretty easy to get.

726
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,280
You can set the ri
so that that's true.

727
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,200
The hard part is
looking at a vertex.

728
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,470
You think about a vertex.

729
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,440
It has a whole bunch
of triangles around it.

730
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,580

731
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:06,150
From this vertex to the central
point, which we usually call p,

732
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:09,850
if you look at that edge-- I'm
not going to try to draw it--

733
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,860
there's, in this
case, five tetrahedra

734
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,030
glued around that edge.

735
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:18,800
The total dihedral angle
of those five tetrahedra

736
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,120
ought to be exactly 360.

737
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,370
If these tetrahedra are going
to fit together and make

738
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:29,045
a solid thing-- and this we
call the reality constraint.

739
00:36:29,045 --> 00:36:31,550

740
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,670
I'm not usually bound by
the reality constraint.

741
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,540
In fact, we will
relax it a little bit.

742
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:42,350
But we would like that the
sum of the dihedral angles

743
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:51,610
around some edge from
P to vi equals 360.

744
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,770
This is the hard
constraint to get.

745
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,840
Reality is tough.

746
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,240
Sanity, convexity, easy.

747
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,740

748
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:06,240
I guess I shouldn't
kill this yet.

749
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,790
So let me tell you a little
bit more about how we get this.

750
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:35,710

751
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,880
I'll just tell you
some of this stuff.

752
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,830
The first thing we do is
get sanity and convexity

753
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,840
and forget about reality.

754
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,715
Reality is overrated.

755
00:37:43,715 --> 00:37:46,370

756
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,100
To do that, we actually
need two things.

757
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,720
One, is we need a
triangulation of the surface.

758
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,470
We're presumably given
some triangulation,

759
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,500
but that one might
be hard to work with.

760
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,290
And the answer is,
to start out, it's

761
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:03,130
nice to use Delaunay
triangulation.

762
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:05,830
How many people know about
the Delaunay triangulations?

763
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,940
They're nice triangulations.

764
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,840
And you can define
Delaunay triangulation

765
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,890
in an implicit
surface like this.

766
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,010
I won't do that here.

767
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:17,480
But it can be done,
and it can be computed.

768
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,880
One of the innovations
in this paper

769
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,620
was to actually show
how to compute it

770
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,180
in pseudo polynomial time.

771
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:26,080
It's not too hard.

772
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,460
It's just shortest paths.

773
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,640
Then, it turns out, if you
start with that triangulation,

774
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,520
and you let all the ri's be
really, really big, close

775
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,940
to infinity, then sanity
and convexity hold.

776
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,359
So I guess intuition may
be like witch's hats.

777
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:41,900
I don't know.

778
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,190
You're making these super-sharp
triangles, tetrahedra.

779
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:45,950
And it will work.

780
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:49,980
Now, it'll make
everything big and equal.

781
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,710
And so reality will be violated.

782
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:58,830
But sanity and convexity
are OK, and that

783
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:01,330
will be your starting point.

784
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,960
So now the crazy
idea is to fix it.

785
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:11,420

786
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,220
I'm going to define
a kind of curvature

787
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:24,930
around each edge, around that
center line from p to vi.

788
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:28,190
That's the sum that we
wanted to be equal to 360.

789
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,070
And now I'm just
taking 360 minus that.

790
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:30,970
That's the deficit.

791
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,310
This is how much we're off by.

792
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,830
So we have some starting point.

793
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:39,750
And it turns out the Ki
will be positive, I believe.

794
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:51,675
And we want to make Ki
evolve with time, so that it

795
00:39:51,675 --> 00:39:54,670
is 1 minus t, times
the initial Ki.

796
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,250

797
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,500
So we start at times
0, with the solution

798
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,939
where all the ri's are large.

799
00:40:00,939 --> 00:40:02,480
So we're staying in
convex, and we're

800
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,010
going to be staying in
convex from then on.

801
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:08,850
And then, if we could do this,
we would start at t equals 0.

802
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:12,020
This is 1 times the original
curvature at every edge,

803
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,640
so it's a problem.

804
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,860
But at t equals 1, at time
1, when this is finished,

805
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,640
we will get 0 times
whatever we had.

806
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,810
So all of these numbers
will magically go to 0.

807
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:24,660
And then it adds up to 360.

808
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,570
It's not obvious that
this works, but it does.

809
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:29,110
It defines a differential flow.

810
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:34,170
And those who know
differential equations,

811
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:37,627
this will look pretty.

812
00:40:37,627 --> 00:40:39,210
This is partial
differential equations

813
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,390
to make it a little
more exciting.

814
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:49,060
This is a kappa and
inverse and phi.

815
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,770
What was phi?

816
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:55,190
I'm forgetting my own
notation, some initial value.

817
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:58,110

818
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,306
It should probably be r.

819
00:41:00,306 --> 00:41:00,806
r?

820
00:41:00,806 --> 00:41:04,090
We'll see.

821
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:08,000
All this is saying
is what I really

822
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,507
want is to evolve
kappas to go smaller.

823
00:41:10,507 --> 00:41:12,965
I don't know how to do that,
because all I can do is change

824
00:41:12,965 --> 00:41:13,647
the ri's.

825
00:41:13,647 --> 00:41:14,980
That's the only thing I control.

826
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,720
The kappas are computed
as a function of the ri's.

827
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,740
There's a standard trick in
analysis-- or I guess, whatever

828
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:26,800
that is, calculus--
to rewrite things.

829
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,180
You get to control the ri's.

830
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:31,450
You want to control the kappas.

831
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:36,000
So you use this thing, which
is called the Jacobian.

832
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,640

833
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,150
It's a matrix.

834
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:43,100
But really, it says,
if I change ri,

835
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,730
how does that change kappa j?

836
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,232
It says that for all i and j.

837
00:41:46,232 --> 00:41:48,190
So it's just a whole
bunch of different values.

838
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:50,050
They're really functions.

839
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,480
You invert that
because you really

840
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,140
want to know how--
I want to change

841
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,850
the ri's in order to
affect the kappas.

842
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:01,090
So you write this
differential equation.

843
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:07,090
And you just follow your nose,
and it tells you what to do.

844
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,870
I'm going to slide a whole
bunch of details under the rug.

845
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:13,020
The hard part is proving that
this relation is actually

846
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,310
feasible, that you can
change the ri's in order

847
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:17,690
to change the kappas,
no matter how you want.

848
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:21,510
This is equivalent to saying
that the Jacobian is never 0,

849
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,209
and it always has an inverse.

850
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:25,250
And that's hard to prove.

851
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,070
And in fact, they prove it using
the Inverse Function Theorem,

852
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,990
which is what we
were trying to avoid.

853
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:33,110
But hey, it's a
construction of sorts,

854
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,290
and it leads to
that implementation.

855
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:38,490
This, in some sense,
gives you an algorithm.

856
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:40,540
To turn it into an
actual algorithm--

857
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:46,710
as we did in this paper, which
appeared last year-- you need

858
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,300
to make this proof a little
bit more constructive,

859
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,200
a little bit more
algorithmic, let's say.

860
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,842
You don't just want to prove
that this Jacobian is never

861
00:42:54,842 --> 00:42:56,550
zero 0 and that it
always has an inverse.

862
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:58,070
You need to prove
that it's actually

863
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,800
always at least some epsilon.

864
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,460
It's bounded away from 0,
and same for the inverse.

865
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,312

866
00:43:05,312 --> 00:43:07,020
Instead of using
inverse functions there,

867
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,350
and we're totally
constructive, we just

868
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:10,230
look at second derivatives
and bound those.

869
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:13,790
We get a really awful
bound, which is this one.

870
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:17,330
But we do get an explicit
bound on how long, essentially,

871
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:23,310
the algorithm is implemented
and the applet takes.

872
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,920
So, a high-level sketch,
but it gives you an idea.

873
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,461
This is pretty new stuff.

874
00:43:30,461 --> 00:43:30,960
Questions?

875
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,190

876
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:42,139
I want to move on to more
fun topics, let's technical,

877
00:43:42,139 --> 00:43:42,680
I should say.

878
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,770

879
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:47,840
So that's Alexandrov's
Theorem algorithms.

880
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,050
In theory, there's
now a computer program

881
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:55,650
that will tell you
how to fold something,

882
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:58,030
as long as we have
an Alexandrov gluing.

883
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:59,210
So it has to be polyhedral.

884
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,376
That's pretty much for free.

885
00:44:00,376 --> 00:44:01,224
It has to be convex.

886
00:44:01,224 --> 00:44:02,390
That's the interesting part.

887
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,310
It has to be a
topological sphere that

888
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:06,350
is just non-crossing.

889
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,590
So let's think about gluings.

890
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:10,660
We know that as long as
we find a good gluing,

891
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,680
it corresponds to something.

892
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,730
We know that something's
a little hard to find.

893
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,935
But we'll see how we
find them in practice.

894
00:44:16,935 --> 00:44:17,670
It's kind of fun.

895
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:21,310

896
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:23,800
We talked about the
decision problem.

897
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,220
Is it possible at all
for a given polygon?

898
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:30,712
So here's a polygon where
it's not possible at all.

899
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:31,920
It's kind of fun-- ungluable.

900
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:38,240

901
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,365
I should make that sharper.

902
00:44:39,365 --> 00:44:43,470

903
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:45,341
So this is a polygon.

904
00:44:45,341 --> 00:44:46,215
This is the material.

905
00:44:46,215 --> 00:44:49,600

906
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,720
I want to glue it
into a convex shape.

907
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,740
I claim it's not possible.

908
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:58,120
The reason is, think
about this vertex.

909
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:02,018
What could get glued
to that vertex?

910
00:45:02,018 --> 00:45:03,531
It has to be less than 360.

911
00:45:03,531 --> 00:45:04,780
Right now, it's less than 360.

912
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,140
It's that much material.

913
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,910
Could I glue any other
vertex to that point?

914
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:11,410
No.

915
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:13,950
Because all the other vertices
have at least 90 degrees

916
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,130
of material.

917
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,000
This one has even more.

918
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,250
But all them have at least 90.

919
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:20,320
And there's less
than 90 remaining.

920
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,180
So no other vertex
could be glued there.

921
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,430
The other possibility, it
doesn't have to be a vertex.

922
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,410
It could be a point in
the middle of an edge.

923
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:27,830
But that has 180 degrees.

924
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:31,110
That's way too much,
so nothing fits there.

925
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:33,120
Therefore, I have
glue like this.

926
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,330
This is what we call zipping.

927
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:38,800
I zip those two
edges to each other.

928
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,990
Now, they happen to be
exactly the same length.

929
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:44,810
Therefore, this vertex
gets glued to that vertex.

930
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:47,140
But that's not allowed,
because there's more than 180

931
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,140
and more than 180
here-- contradiction.

932
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,068
So that's it.

933
00:45:52,068 --> 00:45:55,845
This can actually happen a lot.

934
00:45:55,845 --> 00:45:59,080
Let me formalize that.

935
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:06,350

936
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:09,015
So we could look at what you
might call the generic case.

937
00:46:09,015 --> 00:46:13,020

938
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,490
And I won't call it
the generic case.

939
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:19,900
But there's a back reference
there, all the linkage stuff.

940
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,980
I can explicitly think
about the random case.

941
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,020
Suppose you choose all
the lengths of your edges

942
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:27,390
and all you angles at
random in your polygon.

943
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:29,260
You get some messy thing.

944
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:36,080
But the point is,
around half the vertices

945
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:41,820
will be reflex
angle, more than 180.

946
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,400
And those are kind of troubled.

947
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,350
Because if you have a
reflex vertex like this,

948
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:50,650
in particular, you can't
glue the middle of an edge.

949
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:53,090
Because that has 180.

950
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:55,300
You can only blue
convex vertices

951
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,900
that have some smaller
angle into there.

952
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:04,010
Otherwise, use zip, and
zipping would be like this.

953
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:07,990
So, what do I want to say?

954
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:08,600
Yeah, I see.

955
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,260
Right, cool.

956
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,571
Before I get to zipping,
maybe I glue some convex angle

957
00:47:13,571 --> 00:47:14,070
in there.

958
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:15,430
It's the same kind of analysis.

959
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:16,721
Maybe I glue some convex angle.

960
00:47:16,721 --> 00:47:18,812
But if the angles
are chosen at random,

961
00:47:18,812 --> 00:47:21,020
I'm not going to get lucky
and completely flatten out

962
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:21,519
the vertex.

963
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:22,390
It won't disappear.

964
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:24,360
That would be too
much to hope for.

965
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,960
So most the time,
I'm going to glue

966
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,790
in-- maybe I glue
in some material.

967
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:28,936
Then I glue in some more.

968
00:47:28,936 --> 00:47:30,060
At some point, I get stuck.

969
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,190
I can't glue anymore in, or
I decide I don't want to.

970
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:35,450
At that point, I must zip.

971
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:37,680
This is a rather
ambiguous notation.

972
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,370
But zipping, I want to glue
this edge to that edge.

973
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:43,870
Well, how long can
I zip them for?

974
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:47,160

975
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,231
Well, let's say I zip them.

976
00:47:49,231 --> 00:47:51,850

977
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:53,930
At any moment here,
I'm gluing a 180 degree

978
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,510
angle to another
180 degree angle.

979
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,242
I can't stop zipping
once I start.

980
00:47:57,242 --> 00:47:59,450
Because there's nothing else
that could fit in there.

981
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:04,710
So I've got to zip
until I get to a corner.

982
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:07,500
There's going to be some
corner, some vertex, that's

983
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,162
glued to some point.

984
00:48:10,162 --> 00:48:11,870
Now, is it going to
be glued to a vertex?

985
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:13,210
Well, that would
be awfully lucky.

986
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:14,420
That would mean
that these two edges

987
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,628
have exactly the same length.

988
00:48:15,628 --> 00:48:17,980
That's not going
to happen randomly.

989
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,650
One of these is going to
be larger than the other.

990
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:25,120
Now I'm gluing some angle
to a 180 degree angle.

991
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,270
The result is another
reflex vertex.

992
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,230
This will keep going.

993
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:33,390
And you'll never finish.

994
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:34,910
So this is a bit hand wavy.

995
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:38,500
But you can see the textbook
for more formal argument.

996
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:42,550

997
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:43,190
I have it here.

998
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:46,710
I'll finish it for you.

999
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:49,420
This would be fine if
this vertex is convex.

1000
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,110
This is less than 180.

1001
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:54,096
But actually, with
probability 1/2,

1002
00:48:54,096 --> 00:48:55,470
it's going to be
a reflex vertex.

1003
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:58,330
And then you're screwed, because
now you have more than 180

1004
00:48:58,330 --> 00:48:59,290
gluing to 180.

1005
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:00,950
That's more than 360.

1006
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:03,350
So you don't even have to
go all the way to the end.

1007
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:05,770
Immediately, after
the very first zip,

1008
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:07,900
with probability
1/2, you'll fail.

1009
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:12,210
I you have n vertices, and
half of them are reflex,

1010
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:14,200
a quarter of them
are going to fail.

1011
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,608
So that's plenty, as long
as n is bigger than 4.

1012
00:49:17,608 --> 00:49:20,660
For n large, you're going to get
exponentially high probability

1013
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:23,800
that this fails.

1014
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,670
Most of the time, if you're
choosing random polyhedra,

1015
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:29,600
random polygons,
you can't glue them.

1016
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:34,610

1017
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:39,890
So you've got to be clever,
choose some nice polygons.

1018
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:41,390
It's actually not that hard.

1019
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:44,630
Like the cross, if you
just glued together

1020
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:47,250
a bunch of unit squares,
it'll go into something nice

1021
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,210
probably.

1022
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:51,180
Or here's another great, class.

1023
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,285
Convex polygons.

1024
00:49:52,285 --> 00:49:56,170

1025
00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:01,160
Convex polygons do
always glue to something

1026
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,990
using something called
perimeter having.

1027
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:09,670

1028
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:13,320
What to do, basically,
by having the perimeter.

1029
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,590
I have some convex polygon.

1030
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:19,700
I'm going to choose any
point on the boundary.

1031
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,380
And then have the
perimeter from there.

1032
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:30,060
So I walk equal distance,
all around this thing-- equal

1033
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:30,910
speed, I should say.

1034
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:37,500

1035
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,440
Something like that.

1036
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:45,390

1037
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:47,010
This is x.

1038
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:52,570
This is the antipodal point, in
terms of measuring perimeter.

1039
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:56,580
Now I zip.

1040
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:58,610
So I'm going to
glue this to this.

1041
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,380
I'm going to glue this to this.

1042
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,896
I drew all those marks.

1043
00:51:01,896 --> 00:51:02,770
I was planning ahead.

1044
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:04,370
Can you tell?

1045
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:07,310
I was trying to make all the
segments the same length,

1046
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:09,752
so that I could properly glue.

1047
00:51:09,752 --> 00:51:11,710
Something I've never
really said about gluings,

1048
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:15,900
but you should always glue same
length things to other things.

1049
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:16,400
Segments.

1050
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,504

1051
00:51:19,504 --> 00:51:20,170
OK, there we go.

1052
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:20,878
There's a gluing.

1053
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:23,420
There's no crossings
in that glowing.

1054
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:24,230
You can check.

1055
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:25,480
Its Alexandrov.

1056
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:29,760
It is convex, because
what do I glue to what?

1057
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,395
Well, here, maybe
I'm going this vertex

1058
00:51:32,395 --> 00:51:33,520
to the middle of this edge.

1059
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,720
But it's a convex vertex.

1060
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,320
So that's OK.

1061
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,575

1062
00:51:37,575 --> 00:51:38,700
Everything looks like that.

1063
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,542
You're always gluing some
vertex to some other edge.

1064
00:51:41,542 --> 00:51:42,875
And all the vertices are convex.

1065
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:45,170
So it will be less than 360.

1066
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:48,230
Maybe, if you got lucky, some
edge will glue to some edge.

1067
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,740
But that's still barely OK.

1068
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:53,350
So for convex polygons,
it's always going to work.

1069
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:56,150
Let's try it out, shall we?

1070
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:58,650
I don't want to use this page,
because I'm not done with it.

1071
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:01,970
We'll take page one,
make a convex polygon.

1072
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:10,640

1073
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,290
I don't want to make
it too complicated.

1074
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:16,231
I'll spend a lot of time taping.

1075
00:52:16,231 --> 00:52:18,480
You an try this at home with
your own, favorite convex

1076
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:18,979
polygon.

1077
00:52:18,979 --> 00:52:20,860
Here's a convex polygon.

1078
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:23,090
And now, we're going
to pick a point.

1079
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:27,930

1080
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:31,170
Do I have a good
point written here?

1081
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:34,250
Let's try here.

1082
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:37,150

1083
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:40,590
See that point, purple?

1084
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,980
Now we are going to zip.

1085
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:46,300
So take this.

1086
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,610
I glue those edges together.

1087
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:51,136
I don't have glue, or
glue takes a while to dry.

1088
00:52:51,136 --> 00:52:52,260
So we're going to use tape.

1089
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:55,020

1090
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:55,520
Ta-da.

1091
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,060

1092
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,810
Now, we have to
glue a little more.

1093
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:04,296
I'm going to pretend
those just met.

1094
00:53:04,296 --> 00:53:07,630
Eh, it's a little ugly.

1095
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:09,180
Man, couldn't I have
chosen something

1096
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,221
a little more degenerate?

1097
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:13,725

1098
00:53:13,725 --> 00:53:15,600
Here, it really does
work in the random case,

1099
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,105
which is fine, as long as
I was restricted to convex.

1100
00:53:18,105 --> 00:53:21,136

1101
00:53:21,136 --> 00:53:23,351
Now, we're going to
If you brought tape,

1102
00:53:23,351 --> 00:53:24,225
you can try yourself.

1103
00:53:24,225 --> 00:53:28,398

1104
00:53:28,398 --> 00:53:29,690
Tape a little more.

1105
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:33,690

1106
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:36,180
See, it's already making
a convex polyhedron.

1107
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,280
It's like magic.

1108
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,730
For a long time, we've
tried to turn this process

1109
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:42,920
into an algorithm.

1110
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,740
Because it looks
pretty good, right?

1111
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:49,425
But we have not been
able to formalize this.

1112
00:53:49,425 --> 00:53:51,925
This differential flow does not
really follow our intuition.

1113
00:53:51,925 --> 00:53:55,890

1114
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:57,890
Now, I'm going to glue
these are edges together.

1115
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:05,037

1116
00:54:05,037 --> 00:54:06,620
This is when I wish
I had three hands.

1117
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:19,998

1118
00:54:19,998 --> 00:54:20,810
A little more.

1119
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:40,220

1120
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:43,550
And there, we've computed
the antipodal point.

1121
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:44,920
In theory, you would zip that.

1122
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,910
But I'm going to leave
it open to give myself

1123
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:49,070
some maneuverability here.

1124
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:50,570
So you puff it out a little.

1125
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:54,130
It will be kind of
round and convex.

1126
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:55,590
Now, that's not
quite a polyhedron.

1127
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:57,960
But this is a polyhedral metric.

1128
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,070
And Alexandrov's
Theorem says this

1129
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:02,370
should make a unique
convex polyhedron.

1130
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:05,850
And with a little bit of
practice and thinking about it,

1131
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:08,810
you can derive that actually
this must be an edge here.

1132
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:12,240

1133
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,160
It's more of an intuition thing.

1134
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,390
See, it looks like this
really wants to bend there.

1135
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:19,930
So that must be an edge.

1136
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:22,930
This one looks like it
must be an edge here.

1137
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:24,180
This gets a little hard to do.

1138
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,360

1139
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,720
But this is how we
used to do them.

1140
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:33,520
Wow, this probably
still is how we do them.

1141
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,057
I haven't done a lot
of these in a while.

1142
00:55:37,057 --> 00:55:38,515
It looks like
there's an edge here.

1143
00:55:38,515 --> 00:55:41,225

1144
00:55:41,225 --> 00:55:46,966
Oh boy, something like that.

1145
00:55:46,966 --> 00:55:50,820
Here there already is and
edge, kind of convenient.

1146
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,820
Here there's an edge.

1147
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:56,950

1148
00:55:56,950 --> 00:56:00,215
I'm just folding point to point.

1149
00:56:00,215 --> 00:56:02,250
I'm almost triangulated.

1150
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,125
I've got a nice line there.

1151
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:09,284

1152
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:10,950
It's starting to look
like a polyhedron.

1153
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:11,991
There's a couple missing.

1154
00:56:11,991 --> 00:56:15,120
This guy probably has
a diagonal somewhere.

1155
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,060
I would guess here.

1156
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:20,470
And on the bottom, there's
a diagonal missing,

1157
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:24,387
I would guess, here.

1158
00:56:24,387 --> 00:56:25,970
One of them is going
to make it reflex

1159
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:27,750
when the other one
will make it convex.

1160
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:28,910
You can experiment.

1161
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:32,590
Then you unfold, ideally,
and make a better version

1162
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:36,170
of this with more properly
drawn lines and then refold it.

1163
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:41,930
And I bet you it makes a
beautiful convex polyhedron.

1164
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:46,060
So this is the
experimental approach.

1165
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:50,540
And this gives you a hands-on
feel for Alexandrov's Theorem.

1166
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:57,344

1167
00:56:57,344 --> 00:56:58,316
Like that.

1168
00:56:58,316 --> 00:57:03,190

1169
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:05,630
Yeah, almost.

1170
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:08,850
Believe me, it's a
triangulated convex polyhedron.

1171
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:09,350
Gorgeous.

1172
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:13,160

1173
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,374
That's how it works.

1174
00:57:14,374 --> 00:57:16,290
And you can try for your
own convex polyhedron

1175
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:18,570
where you're
guaranteed not to fail.

1176
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:21,710
Now, you prove some nice things
about these perimeter havings.

1177
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:24,950
In particular, I had this
flexibility of where I started

1178
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:26,450
and where I ended.

1179
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:29,310
And I could move those
points continuously.

1180
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:32,690
There's infinitely many
choices for x and y.

1181
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:35,980
And certainly, there's
infinitely many gluings.

1182
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:38,800
I can just keep moving x and
moving y correspondingly.

1183
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,150
There's a whole
continuum of gluings.

1184
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:42,990
They're all different.

1185
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:46,500
They all generate
different polyhedra,

1186
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,690
if you think about it.

1187
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:54,627
Because if you think
of x being very close.

1188
00:57:54,627 --> 00:57:56,960
x is definitely going to be
a vertex of your polyhedron.

1189
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,859
Because you end up gluing
this part of the edge

1190
00:58:00,859 --> 00:58:01,900
to this part of the edge.

1191
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,210
So you have 180 degrees
of material there.

1192
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:08,779
That's a vertex, less than 360.

1193
00:58:08,779 --> 00:58:10,320
And this is also a
vertex, let's say.

1194
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,160
Look at the nearest
neighbor to x.

1195
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,700
Here is a distance
between two vertices.

1196
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,716
It's the shortest path.

1197
00:58:16,716 --> 00:58:18,340
If you make x very
close to the vertex,

1198
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:20,680
it will be a shortest path.

1199
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,350
And you're setting
that to infinitely

1200
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:26,150
many different values, a whole
continuum, very close to 0.

1201
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:28,590
If you look at some polyhedron
that this thing realizes,

1202
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:30,377
it has whatever, n vertices.

1203
00:58:30,377 --> 00:58:32,460
You look at the n squared
different shortest paths

1204
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:33,001
between them.

1205
00:58:33,001 --> 00:58:34,626
That's some finite
set of real numbers.

1206
00:58:34,626 --> 00:58:37,042
And here, I'm supposed to get
a continuum of real numbers.

1207
00:58:37,042 --> 00:58:38,690
Therefore, the set
of all polyhedra

1208
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:41,544
that you are making in this
process is a continuum.

1209
00:58:41,544 --> 00:58:42,460
There's a lot of them.

1210
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,392

1211
00:58:45,392 --> 00:58:47,100
Most of the things
you'll get out of this

1212
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,427
are different polyhedra.

1213
00:58:48,427 --> 00:58:50,010
If I started with a
different x and y,

1214
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:51,676
I'd get a slightly
different polyhedron.

1215
00:58:51,676 --> 00:58:57,421
It will change continuously,
but it will be different.

1216
00:58:57,421 --> 00:58:59,420
So this is the sense in
which, at the beginning,

1217
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:01,755
I said there infinitely
many gluings.

1218
00:59:01,755 --> 00:59:05,049

1219
00:59:05,049 --> 00:59:06,840
Really, the only time
that they're infinite

1220
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,290
is when you have a
convex polygon somewhere

1221
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:11,255
embedded inside your polygon.

1222
00:59:11,255 --> 00:59:14,380
It doesn't have
to be at the top.

1223
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:16,298
All right, where
do I want to go?

1224
00:59:16,298 --> 00:59:16,798
Here.

1225
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:43,170

1226
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:48,010
One way to think about
gluings is all these arrows

1227
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:48,969
that are not crossing.

1228
00:59:48,969 --> 00:59:50,760
But it's a little bit
awkward to work with.

1229
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,580
And next class we're
going to really find

1230
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,570
algorithms to compute
these gluings.

1231
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:57,820
And it's useful to have
another structure, another way

1232
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:02,390
of looking and gluings,
called the gluing tree.

1233
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,710
And the main idea is to
take your polygon, which

1234
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:07,840
I'm going to explicitly shade.

1235
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,320
Because you're
soon going to lose

1236
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:13,180
track of where it is
if I don't shade it.

1237
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:14,680
So that's the inside
of the polygon,

1238
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,030
and there's outside space.

1239
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:19,020
I want to turn this
whole picture inside out.

1240
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:21,141
Think of this as
living on a sphere.

1241
01:00:21,141 --> 01:00:22,890
On the sphere, there's
some shaded region.

1242
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:24,260
That's the material.

1243
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:28,890
And then there's the rest,
the black of the blackboard.

1244
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:31,010
If I look on the other
side of the sphere,

1245
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:35,260
my perspective will be, I
have some convex polygon.

1246
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:37,580
And the interior of the
polygon is on the outside.

1247
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:40,540

1248
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:43,710
This is a useful way of
thinking about things.

1249
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:46,320
So there's my
polygons out there.

1250
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:51,710
Now in fact, in a convex case,
this would be less than 180.

1251
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:53,340
It's hard to see
that in this picture.

1252
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:54,830
But just think of
it topologically.

1253
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:56,684
Don't worry so much
about the geometry.

1254
01:00:56,684 --> 01:00:59,100
Now, what I'm trying to do--
it's a little easier to think

1255
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,950
about, oh, I need to glue
this edge to this edge

1256
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:05,910
and then maybe glue
up to whatever.

1257
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,570
Maybe these were
the full length.

1258
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:11,080
Then I'll glue this edge to
this portion of that edge.

1259
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:20,775
So I still can draw my
arrows, something like that.

1260
01:01:20,775 --> 01:01:23,567
This would be a
parameter having gluing.

1261
01:01:23,567 --> 01:01:25,150
I can still draw
them, but now they're

1262
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:26,700
on the inside instead
of the outside.

1263
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,360
It's easier to see them.

1264
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,020
And in particular,
I could actually

1265
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,603
say, well, if I want to go that
edge to that edge, why don't I

1266
01:01:32,603 --> 01:01:34,870
draw them next to each other?

1267
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:39,010
So it would look like this.

1268
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:43,200
Then have these edges when I
draw them next to each other.

1269
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:49,000
And then I have those edges
and then that edge and then

1270
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,120
the little edges, except these
are actually the same point.

1271
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:57,420
So it would look like that.

1272
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:00,980
I think of these as almost
touching and then the material

1273
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:03,500
still on the outside.

1274
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:08,380
It's not looking so white
anymore, but you get the idea.

1275
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:09,790
Well, that's a path.

1276
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:12,490
In general, you get a tree.

1277
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:18,190
So a gluing tree will look
something like this, maybe.

1278
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:19,260
It's a double tree.

1279
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:22,940
There's an underlying tree here,
and then you walk around it.

1280
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:24,580
And the material
is all out here.

1281
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:28,610

1282
01:02:28,610 --> 01:02:31,520
It's like that's
where you're gluing.

1283
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,840
Now, this is actually
really intuitive to us.

1284
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,230
It could be.

1285
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:38,790
When we were thinking
about where to cut along

1286
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:40,940
the surface of a
convex polyhedron,

1287
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:45,530
at some point we said, well,
in a convex polyhedron,

1288
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:47,550
we had all these properties
that, in the end,

1289
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:50,500
said the cuts must be a
spanning tree of the vertices.

1290
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,131
Every vertex must get cut too.

1291
01:02:52,131 --> 01:02:53,880
And you can't have any
cycles in the cuts,

1292
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:56,180
because that would
disconnect the surface.

1293
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:58,640
So where you cut was
a set of was a tree,

1294
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,640
a set of edges forming a tree.

1295
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:06,070
That's the cut tree, just
viewed from the other side.

1296
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:07,404
That's where we want to glue.

1297
01:03:07,404 --> 01:03:09,320
Folding is supposed to
be exactly the opposite

1298
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,620
of unfolding.

1299
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:14,070
That's why the gluing
tree is a tree.

1300
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:20,910

1301
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:23,110
You could think about
some interesting things

1302
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:28,440
like where are the vertices
of my polygon in that picture?

1303
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:31,077
So here, I made all these
notches, but not all of them

1304
01:03:31,077 --> 01:03:31,660
were vertices.

1305
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:34,370
Some of them were
the middles of edges.

1306
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:37,050
So this one might be 180,
meaning it wasn't really

1307
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:38,640
a vertex of the polygon.

1308
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,610
It was the middle of an edge.

1309
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:45,190
Obviously, if I
look at some vertex

1310
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:52,070
where three corners are coming
together, if one of them

1311
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:55,430
was 180 and another
one was 180, we

1312
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:58,700
would not have room for a third.

1313
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:01,010
At a degree 3 vertex
or more, it could have,

1314
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:02,910
at most, one middle of an edge.

1315
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:05,390
These guys, the
other remaining guys,

1316
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:08,580
must be vertices of the polygon.

1317
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:12,100
The middle of an edge
could be two 180s.

1318
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:14,860
That's actually
the typical case.

1319
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:19,745
If you look at one of these
gluings, most of the points,

1320
01:04:19,745 --> 01:04:21,120
it's the middle
of an edge gluing

1321
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,700
to another middle of an edge.

1322
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:25,580
That's what's happening
almost everywhere.

1323
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:30,710
But you could also have some
180 gluing to some vertex.

1324
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:36,227
But then it had better be a
convex vertex, less than 180.

1325
01:04:36,227 --> 01:04:37,810
You can go around
and think about what

1326
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:41,137
all these situations are.

1327
01:04:41,137 --> 01:04:42,720
When there's a 180,
the remaining guys

1328
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,660
had better be convex.

1329
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:48,449
And their total angle had
better be less than 180.

1330
01:04:48,449 --> 01:04:49,365
What about the leaves?

1331
01:04:49,365 --> 01:04:57,240

1332
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:58,355
This is a zipping place.

1333
01:04:58,355 --> 01:05:01,150
I was talking about zips before,
were you just locally join

1334
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:04,230
the two incident
edges to themselves.

1335
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:05,950
The leaves are
where zips happen.

1336
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:08,610
Trees have leaves,
so zips happen.

1337
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:11,520

1338
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,036
Zip happens.

1339
01:05:13,036 --> 01:05:14,866
[LAUGHTER]

1340
01:05:14,866 --> 01:05:16,240
PROFESSOR: This
angle, obviously,

1341
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,840
will be less than 360.

1342
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:20,580
It could be a vertex,
and then at some angle,

1343
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:22,830
or it could be the
middle of an edge.

1344
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:24,770
And then it will be 180.

1345
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:26,860
That's what we had over here.

1346
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:33,400

1347
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:37,212
I chose one and
x to be a vertex.

1348
01:05:37,212 --> 01:05:38,920
But then, generically,
on the other side,

1349
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,670
you're going to get
the middle of an edge.

1350
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:43,970
And the example I did
in reality, both of them

1351
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:45,890
were in the middle of an edge.

1352
01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:49,540
I'm going to make
special note of the ones

1353
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:55,320
where we have
material like this,

1354
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,890
and you end up
zipping like that,

1355
01:05:57,890 --> 01:06:01,990
we call this a fold point.

1356
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:04,930
I don't know why,
but you fold at it.

1357
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:07,690
So it's some shorthand.

1358
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:10,710
So these are fold
points, the leaves that

1359
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:14,130
are at the middle
of an edge, they're

1360
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:18,670
a little special or
a little restricted.

1361
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:22,080
Because how much curvature
is at that point?

1362
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,550
180.

1363
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:32,090
Fold points have curvature 180.

1364
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:34,500
The total curvature is 720.

1365
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:37,205
So I can't have more
than four fold points.

1366
01:06:37,205 --> 01:06:46,480

1367
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,530
They're actually quite
rare, but they can happen.

1368
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:51,685
Obviously, we had two of
them in these examples.

1369
01:06:51,685 --> 01:06:56,040

1370
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,390
Can actually have four?

1371
01:06:57,390 --> 01:07:00,720

1372
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,131
Yeah I think.

1373
01:07:02,131 --> 01:07:03,672
AUDIENCE: Could you
have [INAUDIBLE]?

1374
01:07:03,672 --> 01:07:11,540

1375
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:13,510
PROFESSOR: I'm going to
draw an actual folding,

1376
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:15,440
with creases and everything.

1377
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,760
This is a blintz space,
for the origamists.

1378
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:19,730
You fold like that.

1379
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:23,520
You get a doubly covered square.

1380
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:27,725
The gluing tree is
going to look like this.

1381
01:07:27,725 --> 01:07:30,369

1382
01:07:30,369 --> 01:07:30,910
You see that?

1383
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:34,810
And it will be drawn
right on top of that,

1384
01:07:34,810 --> 01:07:37,940
and the actual
material is back here.

1385
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:40,100
So this will be exactly
four fold points.

1386
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,540
And just by luck, you have
these four 90 degree angles.

1387
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:44,149
So there's no more
curvature there.

1388
01:07:44,149 --> 01:07:46,190
So yeah, you can definitely
get four fold points.

1389
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:47,955
I don't know if you can
get a large examples four

1390
01:07:47,955 --> 01:07:48,700
fold points.

1391
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:51,680
AUDIENCE: I think four fold
points means it'll be flat.

1392
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,680
PROFESSOR: Four fold
points means it'll be flat.

1393
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,735
AUDIENCE: So that's going
to be 0 curvature at that.

1394
01:07:56,735 --> 01:07:58,110
PROFESSOR: You're
going to have 0

1395
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:00,200
curvature at every other vertex.

1396
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,730
It's certainly implies
that you are a tetrahedron.

1397
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:06,750
Because you only have
four vertices at all.

1398
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:07,251
So yeah.

1399
01:08:07,251 --> 01:08:09,666
You might be able to start
with some complicate a polygon.

1400
01:08:09,666 --> 01:08:11,430
And then, everything
somehow disappears,

1401
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:15,490
because all the angles match
up in a lucky way, like this.

1402
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:18,244
But the polyhedron itself will
definitely be a tetrahedron.

1403
01:08:18,244 --> 01:08:19,660
I'm not sure if
it has to be flat,

1404
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:22,550
but tetrahedron
is pretty simple.

1405
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:24,680
So it's not so exciting.

1406
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,330
Let me tell you
about rolling belts,

1407
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:29,260
because they're really cool.

1408
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:31,780
And then I think we're done.

1409
01:08:31,780 --> 01:09:00,191

1410
01:09:00,191 --> 01:09:03,420
A rolling belt is basically
an embedded, convex polygon.

1411
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:05,979

1412
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:08,370
And we saw that when we
looked at a convex polygon,

1413
01:09:08,370 --> 01:09:12,997
from the perspective of a
gluing tree, it was a path.

1414
01:09:12,997 --> 01:09:14,080
In general, I have a tree.

1415
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:17,359
And I want to define
when a path in that tree

1416
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,710
is like a convex polygon.

1417
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:21,819
And like in the sense
that it can roll.

1418
01:09:21,819 --> 01:09:25,082
I could move x continuously
and move y corresponding,

1419
01:09:25,082 --> 01:09:26,790
and I'd always have
an Alexandrov gluing.

1420
01:09:26,790 --> 01:09:29,210
So it's like one of
these infinite families.

1421
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:34,220
I'd like to detect those things,
and we call them rolling belts.

1422
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:37,189
They're going to be a
path in the gluing tree.

1423
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:39,680
Here are the
conditions you need.

1424
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:51,560
The endpoints are
either fold points

1425
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,684
or convex vertices, no reflex.

1426
01:09:53,684 --> 01:10:00,520

1427
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,890
In that case, they
must be leaves.

1428
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:11,680
And along that path, you
always have less than

1429
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:19,080
or equal to 180 degrees of
material on either side.

1430
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:24,360

1431
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,130
This is pretty intuitive.

1432
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:27,710
So you have some tree.

1433
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:31,152

1434
01:10:31,152 --> 01:10:33,110
I'll draw a slightly more
general picture here.

1435
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:41,660

1436
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:48,582
And then, I look at some path
in that tree, maybe from here

1437
01:10:48,582 --> 01:10:49,880
to here.

1438
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:55,132

1439
01:10:55,132 --> 01:10:56,840
Yeah, this was the
way I glued things up.

1440
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,739
Now, imagine that I recut here.

1441
01:10:59,739 --> 01:11:01,780
Ideally, these are supposed
to be glued together.

1442
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:04,650
But what if I separated, I
pulled just those parts apart?

1443
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:07,100
I left these intact, all
the sub trees hanging off I

1444
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:08,310
didn't touch.

1445
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:10,040
And then I just
rolled that thing

1446
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,380
like it was a convex polygon.

1447
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:13,920
Which means, instead
of going here to here,

1448
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,740
I'm going to glue this
point to this point.

1449
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:20,580
I'm going to slide
this over a little bit.

1450
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:22,080
Whereas before,
this point was glued

1451
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:26,290
to itself-- that was the end of
the zip-- the new zip point is

1452
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:30,750
going to be-- I can't tell,
everything's moving this way.

1453
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:33,720
This point is going
to move up here.

1454
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,580
And it's going to become
the new zip point.

1455
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:38,890
Everybody here is moving
in that direction.

1456
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:40,960
Everybody here is moving
in that direction.

1457
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:46,580
I just kind of roll that belt
along, and then I reglue.

1458
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:49,450
And as long as it looks like
a convex polygon-- meaning,

1459
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:52,180
as you walk around here,
the total amount of material

1460
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:55,090
getting glued, like, here I
have two portions of material--

1461
01:11:55,090 --> 01:11:59,427
as long as that's, at most,
180 in total, I can do that.

1462
01:11:59,427 --> 01:12:01,260
Because if it's, at
most, 180 on both sides,

1463
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:02,830
it will be, at
most, 360 in total.

1464
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:05,430

1465
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:06,560
So that's it.

1466
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,550
And there's a separate
corner condition.

1467
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:12,207
But all it's saying is that
it's, at most, 180 everywhere.

1468
01:12:12,207 --> 01:12:14,290
And then it's really acting
like a convex polygon,

1469
01:12:14,290 --> 01:12:18,780
but not in total, just in that
little subpath of the tree.

1470
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:21,780

1471
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:23,560
Turns out, this is
the only way to have

1472
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,970
an infinite set of gluings.

1473
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:30,090
All infinite goings will
look like rolling belts.

1474
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:32,350
Now, there can be more
than one rolling belt

1475
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:35,330
in a single example.

1476
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:38,511
And this I can even build.

1477
01:12:38,511 --> 01:12:39,580
It's pretty simple.

1478
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:46,095
I take a rectangle, and I
glue it into a cylinder.

1479
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:55,130

1480
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:57,035
Beautiful, what an
amazing cylinder.

1481
01:12:57,035 --> 01:13:05,987

1482
01:13:05,987 --> 01:13:08,320
But I'm not going to commit
to how the rest of the thing

1483
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,920
is glued.

1484
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:10,970
There's a cylinder.

1485
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:12,240
What did I draw?

1486
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:12,920
The gluing tree.

1487
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:17,770
So initially, my rectangles
out here, imagine.

1488
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:19,870
And I've glued--
what did I glue,

1489
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:22,790
the shortage to the shortage?

1490
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:24,910
So what I end up with,
in terms of gluing tree,

1491
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:26,550
is I have these two edges
that are glued to each other.

1492
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:28,580
And then I have this
big thing, which

1493
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:30,950
I don't know how I
want to glue that yet.

1494
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:32,460
I haven't decided.

1495
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:35,220
So those loops are supposed
to get squashed into a tree.

1496
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:38,260
And that's this
loop and this loop.

1497
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:42,686
You can almost see this is a
weird projection of a cylinder.

1498
01:13:42,686 --> 01:13:44,310
A cylinder goes around
on the backside,

1499
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:45,851
because all the
material is out here.

1500
01:13:45,851 --> 01:13:48,360

1501
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,490
I'm totally free, what
I do with the top here.

1502
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:51,530
It's a rolling belt.

1503
01:13:51,530 --> 01:13:52,571
Look, I can even role it.

1504
01:13:52,571 --> 01:13:53,080
It's great.

1505
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:59,390
I can slide it around,
slide, slide, slide.

1506
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:02,140
I can do this forever,
because it's cyclic.

1507
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:06,200
And then separately, I can
slide this one however I want.

1508
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,250
It doesn't matter.

1509
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:11,090
At all times, I'm just
gluing 180 to 180.

1510
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:13,670
And at the ends, I'm getting
to just single 180's.

1511
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:15,856
Those are fold points.

1512
01:14:15,856 --> 01:14:17,730
Well, this one's not
technically a fold point

1513
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:22,160
if I did it right at the vertex,
but it acts the same way.

1514
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:23,820
So the gluing tree
is always going

1515
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:27,482
to look something like this.

1516
01:14:27,482 --> 01:14:28,690
But each of these could roll.

1517
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:29,840
So it could look like that.

1518
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,790
It could look like it's even.

1519
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:35,950
You get to slide this around.

1520
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:40,370
So it's a double continuum,
a double rainbow.

1521
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:43,370

1522
01:14:43,370 --> 01:14:45,960
In some cases, like this
one, when there are lines,

1523
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,780
you actually get a flat thing,
which is kind of boring.

1524
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:55,050
In all other cases, you will get
a convex tetrahedron, non-flat,

1525
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:57,010
for this one example.

1526
01:14:57,010 --> 01:14:58,140
That's two rolling belts.

1527
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:59,780
Now notice, to have
to rolling belts,

1528
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:02,540
I basically had to
have four fold points.

1529
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:03,790
Sounds familiar.

1530
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:07,550
I can only have
four fold points.

1531
01:15:07,550 --> 01:15:09,380
So it seems like
maybe two rolling

1532
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:11,330
belts is the most I can have.

1533
01:15:11,330 --> 01:15:15,170
Because each rolling belt--
if you roll a little bit,

1534
01:15:15,170 --> 01:15:16,950
it will have a fold
point on either end.

1535
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:19,480

1536
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:23,720
Two is kind of the
max, but only kind of.

1537
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:24,600
You can do three.

1538
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:28,536

1539
01:15:28,536 --> 01:15:29,290
Let's do three.

1540
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:38,000

1541
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,555
Three rolling belts.

1542
01:15:39,555 --> 01:15:44,380

1543
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:48,070
I'm going to take this
example, the blintz space.

1544
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:51,600

1545
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,900
Yeah, let's look at this
example for a little bit.

1546
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:57,150
I hadn't planned this.

1547
01:15:57,150 --> 01:16:01,130
The tree here, is this nice
four star, four-armed star.

1548
01:16:01,130 --> 01:16:07,280
And there's kind of a rolling
belt from here to here.

1549
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:10,360
If I ignore the fact that there
are these things hanging off,

1550
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:14,105
then I have, at most,
180 on both sides.

1551
01:16:14,105 --> 01:16:16,460
It acts just like a
rolling belt Also,

1552
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:17,860
there's a rolling belt here.

1553
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:19,590
They cross each other.

1554
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:21,320
Crazy.

1555
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:27,980
But in theory, it's
a little tricky.

1556
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:29,710
They're not independent anymore.

1557
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:32,980
I can roll one of
them however I want.

1558
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:36,590
But if I roll that one at all,
I cannot roll the other one.

1559
01:16:36,590 --> 01:16:38,820
Because as soon as
you roll-- let's say

1560
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:40,600
I roll the horizontal one.

1561
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:43,560
It'll look like this.

1562
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:46,120

1563
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:49,380
They'll be if you roll that.

1564
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:53,190
So these top and bottom
guys are no longer touching.

1565
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:56,902
And if you try to make
this path a rolling belt,

1566
01:16:56,902 --> 01:16:59,920
it doesn't look so good.

1567
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:07,710
Because here, this side,
there's more than 180.

1568
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:11,732
It's going to have a 90 from
here and 180 from down there.

1569
01:17:11,732 --> 01:17:13,190
So that's no longer
a rolling belt.

1570
01:17:13,190 --> 01:17:14,564
Right now it is,
and I could roll

1571
01:17:14,564 --> 01:17:17,540
just the vertical one or the
horizontal one but not both.

1572
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:19,930

1573
01:17:19,930 --> 01:17:22,180
But the point here is, you
can have rolling belts that

1574
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:26,170
cross or overlap each
other, in general.

1575
01:17:26,170 --> 01:17:34,520
If we do the same thing
with a triangle-- in fact,

1576
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:37,960
I think I'm going to make a
tetrahedron-- look at that.

1577
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:38,589
Amazing.

1578
01:17:38,589 --> 01:17:40,005
Bring those three
points together.

1579
01:17:40,005 --> 01:17:43,820

1580
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:47,432
The gluing tree looks like that.

1581
01:17:47,432 --> 01:17:48,890
This is the top of
the tetrahedron.

1582
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:51,530
These are the other three
vertices of the tetrahedron.

1583
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:53,071
It's a spanning tree
of the vertices.

1584
01:17:53,071 --> 01:17:55,950

1585
01:17:55,950 --> 01:17:58,290
I claim this is a rolling belt.

1586
01:17:58,290 --> 01:18:01,430
And therefore, so is
this and so is this.

1587
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:04,110
So there are three of them.

1588
01:18:04,110 --> 01:18:06,700
Because at this point, well,
that was like a fold point.

1589
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:08,720
There's only 180 degrees there.

1590
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:13,410
As I walk around, here I
have two 60s going together.

1591
01:18:13,410 --> 01:18:16,120
That's less than 180.

1592
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:18,170
And on the other
side, I just have 160.

1593
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:21,060
So it's definitely less
than 180 on both sides,

1594
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:22,410
all the way along this curve.

1595
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:23,930
And by symmetry,
along all three.

1596
01:18:23,930 --> 01:18:25,890
So I can kind of get
three rolling belts.

1597
01:18:25,890 --> 01:18:28,700
They're not independent,
I don't think.

1598
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:33,720
If I roll one of them, it
looks like actually maybe I

1599
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:36,460
can keep rolling the others.

1600
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,920
But this is the only way you
can get three rolling belts.

1601
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:42,185
It turns out, four rolling
belts are impossible.

1602
01:18:42,185 --> 01:18:49,970

1603
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:52,910
This is actually something
we proved in this class.

1604
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:56,380
We've proved it six years ago.

1605
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:58,080
So it's probably
even in the textbook.

1606
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,715
I don't remember,
very simple proof.

1607
01:18:59,715 --> 01:19:04,580

1608
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:07,770
If you have four rolling
belts, even if they overlap,

1609
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:13,515
you have to have a lot of fold
points, at least four of them.

1610
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:15,890
There has to be at least one
fold point per rolling belt,

1611
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:17,264
because they have
different ends.

1612
01:19:17,264 --> 01:19:19,240
At least one end is different.

1613
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:22,506
Here, we had three fold
points and three belts.

1614
01:19:22,506 --> 01:19:26,390
If we have four fold
points, at least four belts.

1615
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:29,690
If you have four rolling belts,
at least four fold points.

1616
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:31,280
Get the right direction.

1617
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,980
We know there's only
four fold points.

1618
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:34,909
So it's actually exactly
four fold points.

1619
01:19:34,909 --> 01:19:37,200
But as you were saying, when
you have four fold points,

1620
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,116
there's really no more
curvature to go around.

1621
01:19:39,116 --> 01:19:41,486

1622
01:19:41,486 --> 01:19:42,610
In fact, this can't happen.

1623
01:19:42,610 --> 01:19:45,120
Because your four fold
points-- all the curvature

1624
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,940
is at those four leaves.

1625
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:50,630
Every other vertex must be
perfectly balanced, has to have

1626
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:51,240
0 curvature.

1627
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:56,190

1628
01:19:56,190 --> 01:19:58,106
And then things break.

1629
01:19:58,106 --> 01:19:59,605
It's not a very
convincing argument.

1630
01:19:59,605 --> 01:20:06,690

1631
01:20:06,690 --> 01:20:07,960
You imagine these fold points.

1632
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:15,086
They're somewhere
in your gluing tree.

1633
01:20:15,086 --> 01:20:17,390
Maybe they're here.

1634
01:20:17,390 --> 01:20:21,830
In order to fit four rolling
belts, there's got to be,

1635
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:26,490
on average, two rolling belts
coming out of every vertex.

1636
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:29,500
And where they diverge,
it's a problem.

1637
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:32,249
Because there has to be
basically 0 degrees of material

1638
01:20:32,249 --> 01:20:34,540
out here for them to roll
that way and to role that way

1639
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:36,260
and have 0 curvature.

1640
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:37,730
So it fails.

1641
01:20:37,730 --> 01:20:41,130

1642
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:42,630
One rolling belt,
two rolling belts,

1643
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:44,820
three rolling belts, no more.

1644
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:46,700
So it's not that
complicated, in terms

1645
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:48,160
of the infinite structure.

1646
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:51,030
What's really interesting is
all the very combinatorially

1647
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:51,959
different trees.

1648
01:20:51,959 --> 01:20:53,500
When I roll a belt,
not much changes.

1649
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:55,680
It's just changing a
few of the lengths.

1650
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:59,680
Next class, we're going to look
at how the trees themselves

1651
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:02,750
can actually change
combinatorially and get bounds

1652
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:04,480
on how many there or
how to compute them.

1653
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:07,340
There's good algorithms
for it, all that stuff.

1654
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:09,140
Still some open problems too.

1655
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:12,274
That'll be next class,
which is on Monday.

1656
01:21:12,274 --> 01:21:13,190
No class on Wednesday.

1657
01:21:13,190 --> 01:21:15,740

1658
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:17,430
That's it.
