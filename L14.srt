1
0-1:59:59,500 --> 00:00:50,065

2
00:00:50,065 --> 00:00:50,940
PROFESSOR: All right.

3
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,670
Let's get started.

4
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,630
So we are continuing the
theme of unfolding polyhedra,

5
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,790
and the general picture we are
thinking about in terms of edge

6
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,170
unfolding versus
general unfolding which

7
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,940
are these two pictures.

8
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,530
Top is an edge
unfolding of the cube.

9
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,180
Bottom is a general
unfolding of the cube.

10
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,140
If you have a
complex polyhedron,

11
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,430
we found general unfoldings.

12
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,741
There are like four of them.

13
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:16,240
They work.

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,299
We proved one of them.

15
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:19,840
If you want an edge
unfolding, that's

16
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,260
the centuries-old open problem.

17
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,852
For non-convex
polyhedra, we know

18
00:01:23,852 --> 00:01:25,060
this is too much to hope for.

19
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,379
Even if it's
topologically convex,

20
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:28,920
there's not always
an edge unfolding.

21
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,910
That was the
tetrahedral Witch's Hat.

22
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,970
But for general
unfolding, we don't know.

23
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,820
So today's lecture is actually
mostly about these two

24
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:45,410
open problems and
different variations of it

25
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,570
that we know how to
solve, special cases,

26
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,660
and changes in the model.

27
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,780

28
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,780
At the end, there'll
also be some stuff

29
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,770
about the reverse
direction folding,

30
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,690
but mostly, it will
be about unfolding.

31
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,800
So there's a third
kind of unfolding

32
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,830
which we call vertex
unfolding, and it's

33
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,400
kind of like a
hinged dissection.

34
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,930
So instead of normally
in unfolding, something

35
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:22,950
like a cross, it's a
nice, connected polygon.

36
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,930
The faces are
joined along edges.

37
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,270
But what if I allowed
disconnecting along edges,

38
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,740
but I just wanted things to
stay connected along vertices,

39
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,110
like at a hinge.

40
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,890
So it still should be
one piece in the sense

41
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,340
that this is still
connected, and in this case,

42
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,210
I still want an edge unfolding.

43
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,780
You're only allowed
to cut on edges.

44
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,980

45
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,000
And in fact, we will
cut on all the edges

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,690
because that'll be
the most flexible.

47
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,010
Every edge gets cut,
but you're going

48
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:09,330
to leave intact certain
vertices to make one, quote,

49
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,470
"piece" at vertices.

50
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,135

51
00:03:18,135 --> 00:03:19,740
So we still want one piece.

52
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,810

53
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:28,369
So this is vertex unfolding,
and it's always possible.

54
00:03:28,369 --> 00:03:30,160
We've even implemented
this algorithm here.

55
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,060
A bunch of random
points on a sphere.

56
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,530
Take the convex hull, and
then, take a vertex unfolding.

57
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,830
So you get this nice
chain of triangles,

58
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,950
don't intersect each other,
and this will fold up

59
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,500
into that 3D
polyhedron on the left.

60
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,091
Here's some bigger examples,
hundreds of vertices.

61
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:47,590
Amazing.

62
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,380

63
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:52,880
All right.

64
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,679
So how do we do this?

65
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:57,178
All right.

66
00:03:57,178 --> 00:04:00,830
Let me state a theorem.

67
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:13,550
Every connected
triangulated manifold--

68
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,800
this is a very general result.

69
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,036
It actually holds
in any dimension.

70
00:04:17,036 --> 00:04:19,410
We're going to think about
two dimensional sources in 3D,

71
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,993
but it could be
d-dimensional surfaces

72
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:23,463
in d+1 dimensions.

73
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,240
--has a vertex unfolding.

74
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:34,140

75
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,920
So this works both for
convex and for non-convex.

76
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,240
The only catch is that every
face has to be a triangle.

77
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,160
It's an open problem
for something

78
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,455
like a cube where you actually
have quadrilateral faces.

79
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:54,760

80
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:00,220
So the way we prove
this is to construct

81
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,625
what we call a facet-path.

82
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:08,140

83
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:13,830
This is a path that
alternates between visiting

84
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:22,410
faces, triangles, and vertices.

85
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,990

86
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,460
So the idea is you
have some-- say

87
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,190
we're doing a
tetrahedron or something.

88
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,520
You start at a facet.

89
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,020
Then, you go to one
of its vertices.

90
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,840
Then, you go to one of the
facets that shares that vertex.

91
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,340
Then, you go to one
of the vertices.

92
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,759
Then, you go to a facet.

93
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,800
Then, you go to a vertex.

94
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,990
Then, you go to a facet.

95
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,880
This is a facet-path.

96
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:55,180
It should visit every facet,
every triangle, exactly once.

97
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,230

98
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,400
Vertices you can
visit multiple times,

99
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,290
although I think it's a bad idea
to visit the same vertex twice

100
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,960
in a row.

101
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,310
Other than that, you can
visit a vertex more than once.

102
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,464
Maybe I would visit it
again coming up here.

103
00:06:10,464 --> 00:06:12,130
If there was another
triangle like this,

104
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:17,550
I could go up to this vertex
again and over to the triangle.

105
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,350
So the claim is
facet-paths always

106
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:24,890
exist for any triangulated,
connected surface.

107
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,190
Once you have this
facet-path, you're

108
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:36,310
basically golden because you
can lay it out without overlap.

109
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,470
And that's the next picture.

110
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:46,480
So if you have a triangle and
you have some corners of it

111
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,620
that are hinged to
adjacent triangles,

112
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,430
you can rotate
that triangle 'til

113
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,410
it fits in a vertical slab.

114
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,150
And the hinges are on
the ends of the slab.

115
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,650
And so each triangle
lives in its own slab.

116
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,999
Slabs don't intersect.

117
00:06:58,999 --> 00:06:59,665
No intersection.

118
00:06:59,665 --> 00:07:13,470

119
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,220
The hard part is really
getting this path.

120
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,690
Once you have that, you
can just lay it out.

121
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,040
It's a little bit nontrivial
with obtuse triangles.

122
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,180
They don't necessarily just
lie along the horizontal line.

123
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,440
You have to set things
up so that those guys are

124
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,920
on the boundary,
but you can always

125
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,465
rotate it so that
that's possible.

126
00:07:29,465 --> 00:07:33,760

127
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:44,420
So the real question is, how
do we construct a facet-path?

128
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:53,320

129
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,300
All right.

130
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,240
So I have a bunch of triangles.

131
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,860
In general, they
make some surface.

132
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,840
And maybe I should draw a
running example over here.

133
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,460
Let's think about a triangulated
cube, something simple.

134
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,720

135
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,999
Imagine there's more
triangles in the back.

136
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:17,040
It's a little hard to
think about the 3D picture.

137
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,100
I would really like to
two dimensionalify it,

138
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,240
and because this
theorem works, not only

139
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,120
for a polyhedron-- it works
for any manifold, any sort

140
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,380
of locally, two dimensional
thing-- it would be nice

141
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,419
if I could just sort
of cut this open

142
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:36,230
and think about a disk instead
of a sphere, topologically.

143
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,936
And I can.

144
00:08:36,936 --> 00:08:38,970
I mean this theorem's supposed
to work for disks just as well.

145
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,610
It should work for
anything that's connected.

146
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,151
So ideally, I cut it all apart
into lots of little triangles,

147
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:45,600
but it has to stay connected.

148
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,740
So I'll unfold it.

149
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,420
Why not?

150
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,920
So I can add some
cuts until I get down

151
00:08:52,920 --> 00:09:01,660
to a spanning tree of the
faces, a spanning tree

152
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,421
of the dual graph.

153
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:03,920
OK.

154
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,584
For whatever reason, this is
the triangulation I chose,

155
00:09:08,584 --> 00:09:10,000
and this is the
unfolding I chose.

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,730
But just keep cutting
edges until cutting an edge

157
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,490
would cause it to disconnect.

158
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,240
So the maximal set of cuts,
there are many ways to do it.

159
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,012
When I unfold, it might
overlap because we

160
00:09:19,012 --> 00:09:20,720
don't know whether
edge unfoldings exist,

161
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,090
but that's fine.

162
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,310
You can think of it as a
two dimensional picture,

163
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,377
but it might need a few layers.

164
00:09:26,377 --> 00:09:28,210
We're not going to
actually fold this thing,

165
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,000
but we're going to cut
this up into a facet-path.

166
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,410
This could actually
be our input.

167
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,280
Instead of being
given a polyhedron,

168
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,770
we're given a disk like
this, a triangulated disk,

169
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,229
and we have to deal with it.

170
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:40,270
Somehow we've got to
construct a facet-path here,

171
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,520
visit every triangle
exactly once,

172
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,325
and passing through vertices.

173
00:09:44,325 --> 00:09:45,700
AUDIENCE: So if
you have overlap,

174
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,182
it doesn't really matter.

175
00:09:47,182 --> 00:09:49,140
PROFESSOR: Yeah, overlap
doesn't really matter.

176
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,480
We're going to cut it
up, and then, we're

177
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,913
going to splay
out the triangles.

178
00:09:51,913 --> 00:09:53,288
AUDIENCE: Distances
don't matter.

179
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:54,650
Right?

180
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,120
PROFESSOR: No, uh.

181
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,120
AUDIENCE: If you're trying
to just find a path--

182
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,212
PROFESSOR: Right.

183
00:09:58,212 --> 00:09:59,910
From the perspective
of facet-path,

184
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,940
distances don't matter.

185
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,860
It's just topology.

186
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,359
Yeah.

187
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:07,930
You could think of it as a
circle with some decomposition

188
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,500
into triangles, if you like,
but that's maybe harder

189
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,350
to think about.

190
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,130
I got to think
about it this way.

191
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,470
It's useful because then,
we'll get to Mickey Mouses,

192
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,500
as we'll see.

193
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:29,810
So cut edges until
you can't anymore,

194
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,425
so until cutting
would disconnect.

195
00:10:31,425 --> 00:10:38,020

196
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,230
So this means what
you're left with

197
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,856
will be sort of a tree of faces.

198
00:10:42,856 --> 00:10:44,980
There'll be no cycles
because if there was a cycle,

199
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,270
you could cut one of the edges,
and it wouldn't fall apart.

200
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,070
So obviously,
there's a tree here.

201
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,480
Now, trees have leaves.

202
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,760
That's our favorite
lemma lately.

203
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,980
They have at least two leaves.

204
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,640
In the case of a
triangulated polygon,

205
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,830
we usually call them ears.

206
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,080
So here's a fun term.

207
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,200

208
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,240
So let's say color the ears.

209
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:18,605
These are leaves and in that
tree which call the dual tree.

210
00:11:18,605 --> 00:11:21,690

211
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,024
So in reality, we're thinking
about a dual graph which

212
00:11:25,024 --> 00:11:26,690
looks something like
this, where there's

213
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,660
a vertex for every triangle and
edges for every edge connecting

214
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,090
triangles, and there's
leaves of that tree.

215
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,320
But in the original thing,
we think of this triangle

216
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,680
as being an ear, and
this triangle is an ear.

217
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,350
And this triangle is an ear,
and this triangle is an ear.

218
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,650
I like ears because they're
kind of on the boundary,

219
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,950
on the surface, so
they're just triangles

220
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,150
that are adjacent to
only one other triangle.

221
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,270
Now, the next step
is to color what

222
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,840
are called the
second-level ears.

223
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,520
I'll call them the
remaining ears,

224
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,470
if you remove those ears, what
would, then, become an ear.

225
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,800

226
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,300
All right.

227
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,031
Now, I wish I had another color.

228
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,760
Yeah, that's kind of yellowish.

229
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,560
So this would become an ear.

230
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,670
This would become an ear.

231
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,242
This would become an ear,
and this would become an ear.

232
00:12:19,242 --> 00:12:21,840

233
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,780
And I'm going to stop
there, just two levels.

234
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,109
What could I get
in this process?

235
00:12:29,109 --> 00:12:30,650
I mean what it looks
like I'm getting

236
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,870
is I get an ear and
then, a second-level ear.

237
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,040
It could be a little
more general than that.

238
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,990
Maybe, for example, if I
had a triangle like this,

239
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,690
both of these would
be first-level ears,

240
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,100
and then, this would
become a second-level ear.

241
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,580
Turns out that's
all that can happen.

242
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,352
Because these are
triangles, second-level ear,

243
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,560
at this point, it's only
adjacent to one other thing.

244
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,260
So what was it
adjacent to before?

245
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,080
Well, maybe, one
ear, certainly not

246
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,500
zero because it wasn't
a first-level ear.

247
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,770
So at least one
ear, maybe two ears.

248
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,657
That's it.

249
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:01,615
AUDIENCE: Unless there's
only four pieces left.

250
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:02,562
Right?

251
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:04,020
PROFESSOR: Sorry,
what do you mean?

252
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,977
AUDIENCE: You could
have three ears.

253
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:07,560
PROFESSOR: You could
have three years.

254
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,680
Yeah, so here I have two.

255
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,596
I mean the first-level
ear and a second-level,

256
00:13:10,596 --> 00:13:13,520
or it could be a first-level--
Oh, you're saying at the end.

257
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,240
Right.

258
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,470
It could be like this.

259
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,720
That would only happen
at the very end.

260
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,730
But yeah, this could
be first-level ears,

261
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,105
and this is the
second-level ear.

262
00:13:21,105 --> 00:13:22,310
Good point.

263
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:33,540
Most of the time, we
will either get something

264
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,970
like this, the rest of
the polygons over here--

265
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,280
so this is a first-level ear.

266
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,520
This is a second-level ear.

267
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:52,610
--or I get-- this is the
Mickey Mouse picture.

268
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,935
Probably not allowed
to say Mickey Mouse.

269
00:13:54,935 --> 00:14:00,150
It's under copyright,
but there you go.

270
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,320
So two first-level
ears, second-level ear.

271
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,177
Boom.

272
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:04,760
This is, most of the
time, what you'll

273
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,170
get in the base case
of this induction.

274
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,554
I'm going to pluck
off these ears

275
00:14:08,554 --> 00:14:09,970
and keep making
the thing smaller.

276
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,130
At the end, there are a
few cases to think about.

277
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,675
I have them drawn here
somewhere, base cases.

278
00:14:16,675 --> 00:14:19,690

279
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,730
Nothing.

280
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,400
Yeah, well.

281
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:30,000

282
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,330
This won't work out if
you have one triangle,

283
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:37,170
if you have zero triangles,
which is this empty picture,

284
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,375
or if you just have two maybe.

285
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,937
Well, I guess--
Yeah, because then,

286
00:14:40,937 --> 00:14:42,270
these are both first-level ears.

287
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,280
It doesn't look quite the same.

288
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,773
Or maybe just a Mickey Mouse
because those are all-- Well,

289
00:14:49,773 --> 00:14:51,090
it probably works.

290
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:56,582
Anyway, these are the sort
of cases you worry about.

291
00:14:56,582 --> 00:14:58,290
But for these cases,
I just need to check

292
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,640
that I can find a facet-path.

293
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,430
So for example, this one,
I just visit the triangle.

294
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:06,320
This one-- I don't
know-- I do it like that.

295
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,160
In fact, I can make it a
cycle if I want to go crazy.

296
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,666
This one-- I don't know--
something like this.

297
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,790
That'd be one way to do it.

298
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,790
(SINGING) Doo, doo, doo.

299
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,900

300
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,850
Hm.

301
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,000
Got to be a little careful.

302
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,500
[INAUDIBLE]

303
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,480

304
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,850
Something like that.

305
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:32,600
All right.

306
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,840
But really, I care
about these two cases.

307
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,356
So what I'm going to
do for each of those--

308
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:47,930
I guess this is
still step four--

309
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:53,206
is I actually want to make
cycles for these guys.

310
00:15:53,206 --> 00:15:54,505
I care about that.

311
00:15:54,505 --> 00:16:02,940

312
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,720
Am I doing something wrong?

313
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,220
Oh, no.

314
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,130
Over there.

315
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:06,630
Good.

316
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,406

317
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:11,280
So in both of these
cases, I can make cycles.

318
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,220
In this one, in the
base cases, not always.

319
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,270
Like this guy, hard
to make a cycle.

320
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,370
But for the two
general cases, if I

321
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,870
find two ears or three ears,
I can just draw that in.

322
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,256
So I'll do that for this
example, though, by now,

323
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:26,256
it's gotten a little
messy, so let me redraw it.

324
00:16:26,256 --> 00:16:30,430

325
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:43,130
So we have-- All right.

326
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:48,890
So I'm going to connect these
guys and connect these guys.

327
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,580
This case, I only
get the two-ear case,

328
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,720
but I think we'll get
another case shortly.

329
00:16:52,720 --> 00:17:00,870

330
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,680
OK?

331
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,900
So obviously, I haven't finished
it, and these are disconnected.

332
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,250
There's lots of
things left to do.

333
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,670
But then, the idea is repeat.

334
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,190

335
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,380
So imagine those
guys as being done.

336
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,849
I'm left with these
four triangles,

337
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:22,140
actually, a little
boring because I

338
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,589
don't get the Mickey Mouse case.

339
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:26,220
But then, this will be an ear.

340
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,910
This will be a second-level ear.

341
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:31,880
And so I'll end up doing this.

342
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,040
And this will be
an ear, and this

343
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,530
will be an ear,
second-level here.

344
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,869
I mean this is actually
the base case, if you will.

345
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:42,160
So in general, I just pluck
off two or three triangles,

346
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,540
repeat until I get
one of the base cases.

347
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,610
Now, what I have
is not connected,

348
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,810
but it's a bunch of cycles.

349
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:54,045
But there's one cycle here, one
cycle there, one cycle there.

350
00:17:54,045 --> 00:17:55,670
You could actually
connect some of them

351
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,711
together, like these two.

352
00:17:56,711 --> 00:17:59,320
You could go around like
this and then, go like that,

353
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,280
so that could be a bigger cycle.

354
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,170
But these cycles are not even
attached to these cycles,

355
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,517
so it's kind of a problem.

356
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,850
That's step five is we're
going to fix all the problems.

357
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,520

358
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,580
That'd be a great title.

359
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,695
Connect cycles together.

360
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:20,300

361
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,300
We're going to do that
by local switches,

362
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,370
so here's the general picture.

363
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,160
Suppose you have two adjacent
triangles and two completely

364
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,440
separate paths.

365
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,680
So it's a cycle, so
some cycle over here.

366
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,670
And if this guy shared
a vertex, then I

367
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,820
could actually
connect them together.

368
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,361
So suppose it doesn't
share a vertex.

369
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:42,140
That means it has
to use these two,

370
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,010
and then, it--
something like that.

371
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:50,440
What I want to do is remove
this edge and remove this edge

372
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,560
and, instead, add this
edge and that edge.

373
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,120
So that's a local change, and
now, it will be one big cycle.

374
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,140
We've probably seen
this trick once or twice

375
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:05,340
before, I think in the Mountain
Valley assignment stuff.

376
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,440
So here I have, for example,
these two triangles,

377
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,260
which are adjacent, but
the paths don't meet.

378
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,890
So I'm just going to erase
this edge, put in that one,

379
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,795
erase this edge,
put in that one.

380
00:19:16,795 --> 00:19:23,510
Lo and behold, I have a
bigger cycle now, like that.

381
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,910
Still not everything, so
like these two triangles

382
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,010
don't touch.

383
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:27,900
So erase that edge.

384
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,944
Erase that edge.

385
00:19:28,944 --> 00:19:29,610
Put in that one.

386
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,120
Put in that one.

387
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,640
I'm preserving, at all
times, that I'm a facet path,

388
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,770
and I'm merging components.

389
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,865
So by the end, I'll
have one big component.

390
00:19:39,865 --> 00:19:42,240
Now, I haven't necessarily
described this as a big cycle,

391
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,410
but as I've kind of been
hinting, what I do now

392
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,420
is take an Euler tour
around this thing.

393
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,370
We've seen Euler tours.

394
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,850
All the vertices in this
graph will have even degree.

395
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,460
And so I can take an
Euler tour, and really, I

396
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,810
should take what's called
a non-crossing Euler tour.

397
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,379

398
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:03,420
Point is you've got a
bunch of cycles that touch.

399
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,040
You just walk
around the outside.

400
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,982
That will visit all the cycles.

401
00:20:07,982 --> 00:20:09,690
It'll visit all these
edges exactly once,

402
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,350
and that will actually
be a facet-path.

403
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:17,840

404
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,278
And we're done.

405
00:20:20,278 --> 00:20:23,710
Now, I have a facet-path
for a triangulated cube.

406
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,610
So I can splay out
those triangles,

407
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,440
get a non-overlapping
chain like this.

408
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,390
Actually, it's probably the
top one, something like that,

409
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:33,890
might be.

410
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,140
I may not have matched exactly
what's in the textbook.

411
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,860

412
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,000
Cool.

413
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,980
One slight detail is I was
sort of waving my hands,

414
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,930
assuming there was
actually a cycle here.

415
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,400
I really only need a path.

416
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,770
In fact, there won't always be
a cycle because at the very end,

417
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,430
you're not able to
construct a cycle.

418
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,635
So that will actually
cause you to make--

419
00:20:55,635 --> 00:20:59,190
if I do something like
this, so at least it

420
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,010
can connect to other things.

421
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,202
That will cause you make
two vertices of odd degree.

422
00:21:05,202 --> 00:21:06,660
But that's OK
because there's still

423
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,350
an Euler path that starts at one
of the vertices of odd degree,

424
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,100
visits all the other
edges, and then,

425
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,960
comes to the other
vertex of odd degree.

426
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,425
And I just need a path.

427
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:18,550
You can actually characterize
when you get a cycle.

428
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:24,360
It's when the original thing
is not two-colorable, I think.

429
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,460
Anyway, that's vertex unfolding.

430
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,210
It's kind of easy.

431
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,970

432
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,337
I think we solved most of
it in like an afternoon.

433
00:21:34,337 --> 00:21:35,045
We had this idea.

434
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:39,285
It was cool, and then, we
solved it kind of quickly.

435
00:21:39,285 --> 00:21:40,590
That's how it often goes.

436
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,234
Once you have a cool
problem, it falls quickly.

437
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:46,900
There's lots of interesting open
problems remaining about vertex

438
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,400
unfolding, and they
seem a lot harder.

439
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,420
So for example, what if I have
non-triangulated polyhedra?

440
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,210
And natural version is to think
about what we were originally

441
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,882
trying to attack,
convex polyhedra.

442
00:21:57,882 --> 00:21:59,590
This turned out to
not require convexity.

443
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:02,790
But what about convex
polyhedra, not triangulated?

444
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,830
Is there always a
vertex unfolding?

445
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,990
We don't know about
edge unfoldings.

446
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:11,120
And the answer is no.

447
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,210
Well, no that's not right.

448
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,550
Sorry.

449
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,530
The answer is we don't know.

450
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,470
What's annoying
about this example

451
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,110
is that there's no facet-path.

452
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,120
So there are two things
that could go wrong.

453
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,850
One is that the
facet-path doesn't exist,

454
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,190
and that can happen in
this more general scenario.

455
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,900
And the other is that when
you lay it out, it overlaps.

456
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,270
Both of these things
could go wrong

457
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,490
in the general convex case.

458
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,140
So in this example, this
is a truncated cube.

459
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,860
There's eight triangles
and only six octagons.

460
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,347
And if you look, once
you're at a triangle,

461
00:22:43,347 --> 00:22:45,180
you have to go to an
octagon because there's

462
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,880
no adjacent triangles.

463
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,900
So at best, you could alternate
 triangle-octagon-triangle-octagon

464
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,370
if you want to pack all those
triangles in, but you run out

465
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,810
of octagons to get there.

466
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:58,214
So there's no facet-path,
but maybe, you

467
00:22:58,214 --> 00:22:59,130
don't need facet-path.

468
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:03,460
You could make a tree,
just a little trickier.

469
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,950
Obviously, if you triangulate
that surface, you're done.

470
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:10,530
So the analog of general
unfolding with vertex unfolding

471
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,330
is trivial.

472
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:14,630
You just triangulate, and
then, you use the edge case.

473
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,610
But if you really only
want to cut along edges,

474
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,010
this example can be done.

475
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,950
I mean it has an edge unfolding,
so if it has an edge unfolding,

476
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,650
it definitely has
a vertex unfolding,

477
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,510
but we don't know
how to prove it.

478
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,676
The other thing that could
go wrong is once you have

479
00:23:26,676 --> 00:23:33,190
octagons, even if you could
find a way to lay them out--

480
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:37,130
that's not a very good
octagon-- you can't-- let's say

481
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,150
if your two hinges
were here and here,

482
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,610
if that's where you attach
two adjacent pieces,

483
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,576
you can't fit that
in a vertical strip.

484
00:23:43,576 --> 00:23:45,950
There's no way to turn it so
it fits in a vertical strip.

485
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,680
So also this layout
problem doesn't

486
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,544
work if you have something
more than triangles.

487
00:23:51,544 --> 00:23:53,085
So some pretty
fascinating questions.

488
00:23:53,085 --> 00:23:56,710
It's even open for non-convex.

489
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:02,960
If I take non-convex polyhedra,
and I want a vertex unfolding--

490
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,900
let's say all the
faces are convex.

491
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,135
At the very least, you need
to forbid faces having holes.

492
00:24:10,135 --> 00:24:16,980
If you remember this
example, the box on a box,

493
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,220
this also doesn't have
a vertex unfolding

494
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,720
because still, this guy has to
fit in that little square hole.

495
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,340

496
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,430
But as long as the
faces don't have holes--

497
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:30,810
let's say the faces are convex--
would be a nice version,

498
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:36,050
like the Witch's Hat,
the spiked tetrahedron.

499
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,780
That probably has
a vertex unfolding.

500
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,402
AUDIENCE: If you triangulate that,
it should have a vertex unfolding.

501
00:24:40,402 --> 00:24:41,860
PROFESSOR: If you
triangulate this,

502
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,990
it'll definitely have a--
if you triangulate anything,

503
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,240
it'll have a vertex unfolding.

504
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,880
Yeah.

505
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,380
All right.

506
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,610
That's all I want to say
about vertex unfolding,

507
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,560
and that's sort of addressing
edge unfolding of convex

508
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,560
polyhedra, or actually,
both of these.

509
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,985
Now, I'd like to go to
sort of the real problem.

510
00:24:58,985 --> 00:25:00,860
This is one of my favorite
problems, I think.

511
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:04,020
A bunch of us posed it in '98,
which was right when I was--

512
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,720
or '99, right when
I was starting out.

513
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,520
See, it's tantalizing, in
some ways more natural,

514
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,066
because it's nice to
allow cuts anywhere.

515
00:25:13,066 --> 00:25:14,940
And it could potentially
work for everything.

516
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:19,350
I conjecture every non-convex
polyhedron without boundary

517
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,720
can be generally
unfolded, and there's

518
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,720
some really good evidence for
this as of a couple years ago.

519
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:50,220
That's what I want
to talk about,

520
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,545
which is orthogonal polyhedra.

521
00:25:51,545 --> 00:25:58,310

522
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,620
This is one of my favorite
unfolding results.

523
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:08,330
It's by Mirela Damian, Robin
Flatland, and Joe O'Rourke.

524
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:11,030
They've done a lot of work
in this unfolding area.

525
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:14,380
An orthogonal polyhedron is
one where all the faces are

526
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,140
perpendicular to one of
the three coordinate axes.

527
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,660
So for example, here is
a orthogonal polyhedron

528
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,226
I drew this morning.

529
00:26:22,226 --> 00:26:23,970
If you want to draw
orthogonal polyhedra,

530
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,380
Google SketchUp
makes it really easy,

531
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:30,400
and you can add
shadows and texture.

532
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,470
So there are three
kinds of faces.

533
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:36,730
There's the ones perpendicular
to x, like these guys.

534
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,970
There's the ones
perpendicular to y.

535
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,994
That's all the yellow faces.

536
00:26:41,994 --> 00:26:43,660
And there's the ones
perpendicular to z.

537
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,370
That's these top guys.

538
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,210
So we call them x-faces,
y-faces, z-faces.

539
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:50,980

540
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,560
What we're going to do--
so the theorem is these

541
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,040
have general unfoldings.

542
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,020
That's pretty awesome
because every polyhedron

543
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:03,280
is approximately orthogonal
if you can voxelize it.

544
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,969
So this is really
a lot of stuff.

545
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:07,510
I would love to generalize this
approach arbitrary polyhedra,

546
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:11,400
but that's the
big open question.

547
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,880
So what do we do?

548
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,770
Well, we're going to single
out, from this color coding,

549
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,930
the y-faces.

550
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,790
Just color them yellow.

551
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,240
Then, there's all
the other faces.

552
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,590
Well, they form bands.

553
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,970
They're cycles.

554
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,674
They go around in a loop.

555
00:27:28,674 --> 00:27:32,320
A lot of them here, I've just
drawn as rectangular loops,

556
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,780
but in general, all those
wooden faces, the x- and z-faces,

557
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,790
will form a bunch of loops.

558
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,620
And then, there's
the y-faces which

559
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,995
we're going to have to deal
with, but sort of ignore them

560
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:43,874
for a while.

561
00:27:43,874 --> 00:27:45,540
I should have drawn
it with them erased.

562
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,730
It would look cool.

563
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:49,750
But if you think about
just those bands,

564
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,770
this is sort of how they're
connected together, this tree.

565
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:56,770
There's a big one out here,
and then, it has two children.

566
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,905
There's this one and this one.

567
00:27:58,905 --> 00:28:01,950
And then, this child has
one child hanging off of it,

568
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,620
and this one has two
children hanging off of it.

569
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,310
So that's these two guys.

570
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,514
In general, this guy might
have some children hanging off

571
00:28:11,514 --> 00:28:12,430
the back side as well.

572
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,380
I'm not going to try to
represent that in this picture.

573
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,850
There's just a
bunch of children.

574
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,225
There will be some
front children

575
00:28:17,225 --> 00:28:18,475
and some back children.

576
00:28:18,475 --> 00:28:20,350
You pick some root
arbitrarily, and then, you

577
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,870
have children
going off of there.

578
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,540
Now, if you're orthogonal
polyhedron has genus 0--

579
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,600
it's topologically a
sphere-- this will be a tree.

580
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,230
If it's like a doughnut,
it will have a cycle.

581
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,920
So this theorem only
applies for our genius zero.

582
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,880

583
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,870
So we're going to exploit
that that dual drawing, how

584
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:47,040
the bands are connected
together, is like a tree.

585
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:52,460
So why don't I
write down, a band

586
00:28:52,460 --> 00:29:09,140
is a cycle of x- and z-faces,
and they are connected together

587
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,110
in a tree.

588
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,050
Now, the rough
idea is we're going

589
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,680
to take a depth-first
traversal of this tree.

590
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,290
We're going to
start at the root,

591
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,220
work our way down and come
back, work our way down,

592
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,210
and something like that.

593
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,860
It's not going to
be quite so simple.

594
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:28,210

595
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:31,410
The challenge, I guess you
could say, is avoiding overlap.

596
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:31,910
OK?

597
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,951
If you wanted to unfold
a band, obviously, a band

598
00:29:33,951 --> 00:29:35,510
can just unfold straight.

599
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:38,130
It's like a nice, long strip.

600
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,720
So each band,
individually, is fine.

601
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,886
It's how do you piece those
bands together and then,

602
00:29:41,886 --> 00:29:44,600
have room for the
yellow faces to attach

603
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,866
on the sides, no overlap?

604
00:29:48,866 --> 00:29:53,190
But it can be done with
the awesome, crazy idea

605
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,315
that we'll get to shortly.

606
00:29:54,315 --> 00:29:56,952

607
00:29:56,952 --> 00:29:58,660
It's going to start
out kind of innocent,

608
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:10,950
but the general
approach is always

609
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:18,140
proceed rightward
in the unfolding.

610
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,370

611
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:26,995
So the unfolding will
look something like this.

612
00:30:26,995 --> 00:30:36,410

613
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,087
OK, whatever.

614
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:39,170
Always going to the right.

615
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,040
We start here, and we
might go up and down,

616
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,580
but we never go left.

617
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,600
And then, that's going
to be all the band faces.

618
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,602
All the band stuff will
be connected like that,

619
00:30:50,602 --> 00:30:52,560
and then, there's going
to be yellow faces that

620
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,726
can just hang off the sides.

621
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:56,309

622
00:30:56,309 --> 00:30:57,350
So these are the y-faces.

623
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:00,640

624
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,630
As long as I get
the band to do this,

625
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,760
y-faces can hang up and down.

626
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,100
It's not going to
intersect anybody.

627
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,080
Pretty clear?

628
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,560
So it's clear if
we could do this,

629
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,560
we can get
non-self-intersection.

630
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,550
The amazing thing is
that this is possible.

631
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,400
What this is essentially
a limitation on

632
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,400
is how far you could
turn your bearing.

633
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,002
So you start going right.

634
00:31:21,002 --> 00:31:23,210
You can turn right, but I
could not turn right again.

635
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,871
I have to turn left next.

636
00:31:24,871 --> 00:31:26,620
I can actually do two
left turns in a row,

637
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,645
as long as I was
initially going down.

638
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:31,270
I can turn left twice, then,
I could alternate left-right.

639
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,150
That's always good.

640
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:37,440
Or I could turn right twice, but
only if I'm initially going up.

641
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,280
That's the rules.

642
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,000
As long as I adhere to
those rules, I'm fine.

643
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,450
Now, we're going
to heavily exploit

644
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,260
that we can do
general unfolding,

645
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,760
that we can subdivide
those strips

646
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,710
into lots of little pieces.

647
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:52,100
We're going to subdivide
into a lot of little pieces,

648
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:59,600
an exponential number of pieces,
so this is kind of hard core.

649
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,710
So here is one example.

650
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,930

651
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,690
This is a leaf.

652
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,860
So trees have leaves,
and at the end,

653
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,360
we're going to have
to visit a leaf.

654
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,640
So this is one box.

655
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,750
There's this funny
view, so you can

656
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:18,990
see like a mirror on the bottom
and a mirror on the right

657
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,280
and on the side.

658
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:27,350
So this is if you had one
box, here's what you would do.

659
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,300
And we're actually
assuming-- notice

660
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:34,210
this side does not get covered.

661
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,710
The idea is that
site doesn't exist.

662
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,420
That's attached to the
rest of the polyhedron,

663
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,910
so that's where
our parent lives.

664
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:42,100
And our parent tells us
you have to start at s,

665
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,780
and it says you
better finish at t.

666
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,680
And I want the property
that if initially,

667
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,220
I think, initially,
you're going right.

668
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,400
No, it looks like
initially, you're going up.

669
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,180
It matters.

670
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,410
You can do stuff,
and then, at the end,

671
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,560
you should still be facing up.

672
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,895
So you have to visit all these
faces, but not turn in total.

673
00:33:05,895 --> 00:33:07,520
And normally, that
would be hard to do.

674
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,436
If you just tried to
visit one face at a time,

675
00:33:09,436 --> 00:33:12,140
you can't do that,
but if you visit

676
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:15,160
faces multiple times and kind
of weave around in a clever way,

677
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,380
you can do it.

678
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:23,561
So maybe I'll point
with this thing.

679
00:33:23,561 --> 00:33:24,060
Yeah.

680
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,410
So I start at s.

681
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,560
I go up.

682
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,170
I turn right.

683
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,200
Now, I better turn left.

684
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,340
I go down over here, up there.

685
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,640
I turn left.

686
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,060
Then, I turn right.

687
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,920
So if you follow along here,
I just turn right here.

688
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,390
So now, I go down here.

689
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:44,280
And that is a left
turn because it's

690
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,490
on the bottom, a little
hard to think about.

691
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:51,830
So I turn left here, and
then, I go, turn right.

692
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:58,400
And then, I go down, turn
left and then, right.

693
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,060
This is confusing
that I'm upside down.

694
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:05,810
And I come to t, and lo and
behold, I'm facing up again.

695
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,020
In fact, I basically
just zigzagged.

696
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,731
This would also work if
it was rotated 90 degrees.

697
00:34:10,731 --> 00:34:12,980
I'd initially be going right
and, then, down and right

698
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,159
and down and right and down.

699
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,590
So this can kind
of go in a couple

700
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,226
of different orientations.

701
00:34:17,226 --> 00:34:18,100
It's really powerful.

702
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,974
It also works if t is
on the other side of s.

703
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:22,060
You could do sort of the
mirror image traversal.

704
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,449
Now, obviously, I didn't
cover the entire surface.

705
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:27,440
I'm leaving room for
later, but if this

706
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,210
was all I was going to do, I
would actually sort of fill out

707
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,860
all those strips, just
kind of extend them.

708
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,969
It just makes this
kind of fatter.

709
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:38,570
So this got a little bigger.

710
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,790
I've got the first half
and then, the second half.

711
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:44,429
This is really glued up there.

712
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:46,989
But you can imagine once you
have these sort of paths that

713
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:49,389
visit everything,
you just fatten out,

714
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:51,389
and it's no big deal.

715
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,270
And also, in this
case here, we're

716
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:56,370
imagining-- oh, this is
actually two of them.

717
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,540
Fun.

718
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,270
Two of these strips
joined together.

719
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,170
And so there's a few side faces.

720
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,915
They just attach up and down.

721
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:05,540
They're not going to
intersect anything

722
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,270
because this is not
actually below this.

723
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,186
This is way over here.

724
00:35:08,186 --> 00:35:11,830

725
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:16,110
So that's the
leaves, and I still

726
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,610
haven't gotten to
the exciting part.

727
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:20,440

728
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,510
So imagine you have a band.

729
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:25,389
Just going to represent
that by this big rectangle,

730
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:26,680
and it has a bunch of children.

731
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,530
Remember, it can
have front children.

732
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,870
This is down in
the y-coordinate.

733
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:37,140
And it could have back children
up in the y-coordinate.

734
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,570
And suppose I'm actually
attached to some parent,

735
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:44,511
let's say, as a down neighbor,
and I start at some s.

736
00:35:44,511 --> 00:35:46,260
Let's say I'm told you
have to start here.

737
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,840
You have to finish here, and
you should preserve orientation

738
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,019
because I don't want to have to
think about whether it turned,

739
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:53,560
don't want to have
to depend on that.

740
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,627
So you can do it.

741
00:35:55,627 --> 00:35:57,960
Initially, you must be facing
up because immediately I'm

742
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,392
going to make two right turns.

743
00:35:59,392 --> 00:36:00,850
And I could handle
two right turns,

744
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,641
as long as the next
thing I did was a left.

745
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:04,710
So I come into
this thing saying,

746
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,440
look, you're facing--
this is facing up.

747
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,930
Now, you're facing down.

748
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:11,370
You better turn left
next, and by the end,

749
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,090
I still want to be facing down.

750
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:13,590
OK.

751
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,909
Now, I make two left turns.

752
00:36:14,909 --> 00:36:15,950
Now, I'm facing up again.

753
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:19,730
I tell this guy, you better
turn right next, and preserve.

754
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,584
At the end, you should
be facing up again.

755
00:36:21,584 --> 00:36:22,750
Now, I make two right turns.

756
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,660
Now, I'm facing down,
and so on and so on.

757
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,880
And here, I'm wrapping
around to here

758
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,329
because this is actually
a band that cycles around.

759
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:31,120
Then, I go in here.

760
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,020
It's the same thing.

761
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,320
It's just a little
hard to see because I'm

762
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,470
drawing it on a flat surface.

763
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,670
But if it was on a ring,
it would be much clearer.

764
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,690
Just going left and
right and left and right,

765
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:46,070
alternating direction, so that
I preserve my orientation.

766
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,660
At some point, I get to here.

767
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,590
I loop around.

768
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:53,030
I make a little
wiggle at some point,

769
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,929
and then, I can visit
all the top neighbors.

770
00:36:54,929 --> 00:36:57,470
You just have to slightly switch
your orientation, but again,

771
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,810
preserve that you're doing
left-left-right-right,

772
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:02,390
left-left-right-right,
left-left-right-right.

773
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,530
Then, you will preserve
your orientation.

774
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,863
You tell each of the children
which way you're initially

775
00:37:06,863 --> 00:37:09,570
going, and they
can deal with it.

776
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,469
It's basically telling
you whether s and t

777
00:37:11,469 --> 00:37:13,010
is like this or the
other way around.

778
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,880

779
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,850
OK?

780
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,500
So now, we end up
way up there where

781
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,600
the lavender edge is at t10.

782
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,120
Now what?

783
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,540
We want to come back
here, and I'm not

784
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,087
allowed to sort of
intersect myself.

785
00:37:30,087 --> 00:37:31,920
That would be the paper
going into two parts

786
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,120
of this unfolding,
so that's not good.

787
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,200
But I have all this
space, so natural thing

788
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,170
is to just wander from
there back down to here,

789
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,950
using up the space.

790
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:45,150
So it's going to look like this.

791
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,590
Everything that you
did, you just undo.

792
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,810
Now, where this is
painful is not only

793
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,530
do I have to undo
it in this diagram,

794
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,424
but I have to recursively
undo everything

795
00:37:54,424 --> 00:37:56,840
I did in here, everything I
didn't in here, and everything

796
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,900
I did in here.

797
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,430
So this recursive thing
from this structure

798
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,860
ends up getting doubled.

799
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,200
At the parent structure,
it will also get doubled.

800
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,120
At every level of
the tree, you're

801
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,644
going to double
what was below you,

802
00:38:09,644 --> 00:38:11,560
so that's why you get
exponential, in general.

803
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:21,441
If your tree is ugly
like something like this,

804
00:38:21,441 --> 00:38:23,190
you'll start with
something nice and small

805
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,600
down here, maybe
constant number of terms.

806
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,470
Then, you'll double.

807
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,230
Then, you'll double again.

808
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:27,990
Then, you'll double again.

809
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:30,410
Then, you'll double again,
and it will be exponential.

810
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:33,730
So if this is n, the number
of things you're doing here

811
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,555
is 2 theta n.

812
00:38:36,555 --> 00:38:38,180
On the other hand,
if your tree happens

813
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:43,430
to be nice and balanced,
doubling is not so bad

814
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,770
because here you'll
have constant.

815
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:48,007
This will double
everything below.

816
00:38:48,007 --> 00:38:50,590
This a double everything below,
but there's only log n levels.

817
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:54,110

818
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:56,986
So is that linear?

819
00:38:56,986 --> 00:38:59,110
It should be about linear.

820
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:02,640
It's certainly 2
to the theta log n,

821
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,300
and it matters what
this constant is.

822
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:09,290
I think it's n or maybe n
squared, but not too bad.

823
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,830
So if you're lucky and the just
the structure of your bands

824
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,720
is balanced, it's good.

825
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,100
In general, though, it's
going to be exponential.

826
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,920
Open problem.

827
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,600
Can you deal with these
situations and sort of balance

828
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,170
them and make them only make
a polynomial number of cuts.

829
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,820
Certainly be nice.

830
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:31,460
Exponential number cuts
is a lot, but it works.

831
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,880
You can unfold every
orthogonal polyhedron this way.

832
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,421
I would love to see
an implementation

833
00:39:35,421 --> 00:39:37,110
of this algorithm.

834
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,569
You could only do
it in a computer

835
00:39:38,569 --> 00:39:40,860
because you'd be splicing
into all these little things,

836
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,460
and it would fall apart.

837
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,900
Jason?

838
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,976
AUDIENCE: You've been
making these, I guess,

839
00:39:46,976 --> 00:39:54,805
gadgets such that a voxel
would attach just by a side.

840
00:39:54,805 --> 00:39:58,591
You could imagine it attaching
at a corner, attaching

841
00:39:58,591 --> 00:40:01,050
to multiple sides.

842
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:04,155
PROFESSOR: So you're worried
about-- not quite sure.

843
00:40:04,155 --> 00:40:06,710

844
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:10,340
What we think about is one
band, which looks something

845
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:14,590
like this, attaching
to another band.

846
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,810
That will always
happen on a face.

847
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:20,082

848
00:40:20,082 --> 00:40:21,790
I'm not quite sure
what you're imagining.

849
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:28,760
Maybe something like that where
they share a partial face here?

850
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,165
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
but it could also

851
00:40:30,165 --> 00:40:31,480
be inset into the [INAUDIBLE].

852
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,820
PROFESSOR: If it's inset, I'm
cutting with every-- I maybe

853
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,440
didn't mention that--
through every vertex,

854
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,730
I'm going to slice
with a y-plane.

855
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,752
So that will cut into
lots of little strips,

856
00:40:41,752 --> 00:40:43,960
and then, there's no sort
of overlap with the strips.

857
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,799
I'm subdividing into
little substrips.

858
00:40:46,799 --> 00:40:48,340
So that sort of
deals with that issue

859
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:51,260
if this was moved that way.

860
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,092
Then, there will be
three strips, one

861
00:40:53,092 --> 00:40:54,800
over here, one where
they're overlapping,

862
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,520
and one on the right.

863
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,020
Yeah.

864
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:57,603
Good question.

865
00:40:57,603 --> 00:41:01,690
I forgot to mention the
subdivision at the beginning.

866
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:05,020
Speaking of subdivision
at the beginning,

867
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,745
this leads to another notion
which we call grid unfolding.

868
00:41:08,745 --> 00:41:36,510

869
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:41,110
So the grid of an
orthogonal polyhedron

870
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:45,350
is what you get
when you subdivide

871
00:41:45,350 --> 00:42:01,230
by extending every
face into a plane

872
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,955
and cutting with that plane.

873
00:42:02,955 --> 00:42:04,580
So that's sort of
what I was doing here

874
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,621
when they're overlapping.

875
00:42:05,621 --> 00:42:09,939
Even in this picture,
there's like a face here,

876
00:42:09,939 --> 00:42:11,480
this vertical face,
and so I'd end up

877
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,255
slicing through this thing
with a band in that direction.

878
00:42:15,255 --> 00:42:19,090

879
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:21,427
And I don't know,
this vertex you'll

880
00:42:21,427 --> 00:42:22,760
end up slicing through this guy.

881
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,190

882
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,300
So hopefully, you
can imagine that.

883
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,900
With every vertex,
slice x, y, and z.

884
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,120
That's another way to do it.

885
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,340
And that subdivides
in sort of a nice grid

886
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,870
where every face will
now be a rectangle,

887
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:41,230
and rectangles always meet
whole edge to whole edge.

888
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,900
So it's a nice simplification.

889
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,370
What I'm proposing is add
those edges to your polyhedron.

890
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:49,170
It's kind of like assuming that
you started with unit cubes

891
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:54,210
and build something but kept
all the edges of all the cubes.

892
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:57,200
I want an edge
unfolding of that.

893
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,220
Do those exist?

894
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,045
These are what we
call grid unfoldings.

895
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:06,770

896
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:11,287
So grid unfolding is an
edge unfolding of the grid.

897
00:43:11,287 --> 00:43:13,245
This only makes sense
for orthogonal polyhedra.

898
00:43:13,245 --> 00:43:19,960

899
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,230
Open question.

900
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:23,800
Do grid unfoldings always exist?

901
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,670
It's essentially the
orthogonal analog

902
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:33,087
of this question, edge
unfolding a convex polyhedra.

903
00:43:33,087 --> 00:43:34,670
If you want to go
to orthogonal, which

904
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:38,332
is like in between convex
and general non-convex,

905
00:43:38,332 --> 00:43:40,040
maybe you could hope
for grid unfoldings.

906
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,581
Edge unfoldings
obviously don't work.

907
00:43:41,581 --> 00:43:45,100
We had lots of examples
where those fail,

908
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:49,490
like the cube with little
bites taken out of the edges.

909
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:51,720
But grid unfolding, you
get lots of subdivision.

910
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,090
It might be easy.

911
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:55,160
Well, it's not easy.

912
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,260
I would guess, actually,
it's not possible.

913
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,310
The next best thing you
could hope for is to refine.

914
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:07,990

915
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:14,380
So you take each of
the grid rectangles

916
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:19,850
and divide it into
k by k, so subgrid.

917
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:25,960

918
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,280
So ideally, k is one, and
you're not subdividing at all.

919
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,920
But maybe, you take every
rectangle, divide it in half.

920
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,140
Maybe that's enough to
then be edge unfoldable.

921
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:41,720
That would be sort of a refined
level two grid-like unfolding.

922
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,090
There are a ton of
results about this.

923
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:47,170
They're all partial.

924
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:49,110
Obviously, in the
general situation--

925
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:50,980
I mean this algorithm
we just covered--

926
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,220
you can achieve a
refinement of only 2

927
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:56,670
to the theta n exponential.

928
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,530
When can you do better?

929
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:02,540
Ideally, you get 1 by 1, but
maybe, you can do something.

930
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:10,375

931
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:10,875
What?

932
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:14,370

933
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:15,130
OK.

934
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:15,630
Interesting.

935
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:21,920

936
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:28,120
One thing you could do, with
merely 5 by 4 refinement,

937
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,190
is something called
Manhattan Towers.

938
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:33,829
Let me show you a picture
of Manhattan Tower.

939
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:35,620
No that's not a picture
of Manhattan Tower.

940
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:38,910
This is more crazy examples
of what it's like to visit.

941
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,760
This is not-- this
probably is complete,

942
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,750
but here, there isn't too much
doubling because there's only

943
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:47,420
a single child, more
or less, everywhere.

944
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:50,850
But the unfolding looks
something like that.

945
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,660
Here is Manhattan Tower.

946
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:58,570
So it has a connected
base on the xy plane.

947
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:04,280
And I want to consider z-slices
as I go up in z-coordinate,

948
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,310
and I want those z-slices to
get smaller and smaller, always

949
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:09,430
contained in what I had before.

950
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:10,760
So I never have overhang.

951
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,050
That's a Manhattan Tower.

952
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:15,740
And in that case,
5 by 4 refinement

953
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:18,580
is enough to unfold
these things.

954
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,520
So that's pretty good, still
not perfect, but pretty good.

955
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,120
And this is by the same
authors, like a year

956
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,474
before the general result.

957
00:46:27,474 --> 00:46:29,150
Let's see.

958
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:30,850
I think maybe I have a movie.

959
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:31,495
Yeah.

960
00:46:31,495 --> 00:46:33,350
So this algorithm
has been implemented,

961
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:36,240
at least in some
simple examples.

962
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,490
And it kind of nicely unrolls.

963
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:40,820
You can see a 5 by 4 refinement
in that little staircase.

964
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:44,250
It's, again, to make everything
keep going to the right,

965
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:47,130
but here, they find a clever
way to visit all the faces

966
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:50,915
without having to revisit,
basically, at all,

967
00:46:50,915 --> 00:46:53,040
just visiting each face a
constant number of times.

968
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:59,490

969
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:03,030
And then, we can zoom out,
and you get the unfolding.

970
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,854
So it looks very
similar in spirit.

971
00:47:04,854 --> 00:47:07,270
Of course, the details is how
do you do all that visiting.

972
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:10,470
I'm not going to
cover that here,

973
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:12,550
but you get substantially
less refinement

974
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:13,600
for that special case.

975
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,650

976
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:18,310
Yeah.

977
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:20,210
Another case looks like this.

978
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:20,880
Boom!

979
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,055
AUDIENCE: Woah.

980
00:47:22,055 --> 00:47:23,180
PROFESSOR: Isn't that cool?

981
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,280
I'll play it again.

982
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,690
This is just slightly
more special.

983
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:30,407
So again-- I have three of them.

984
00:47:30,407 --> 00:47:31,240
They're so much fun.

985
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,091
It's like exploding a city.

986
00:47:33,091 --> 00:47:33,590
Boom!

987
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:36,720

988
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,800
So here, the floor
is a rectangle.

989
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,090
That's the only
additional requirement,

990
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:46,770
and again, as you slice upwards,
things only get smaller.

991
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:47,640
Here's a bigger one.

992
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,260

993
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,350
Boom!

994
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:54,180
So exciting.

995
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,200
I could do this all day.

996
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,360

997
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:02,470
So I'm not going to
describe how this works,

998
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:05,540
but you could almost reconstruct
it from these diagrams.

999
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:09,560
This is what we call
an orthogonal terrain.

1000
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,340
This result by Joe O'Rourke.

1001
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:16,690
Here, you don't need any
refinement, grid unfolding, one

1002
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:17,597
by one.

1003
00:48:17,597 --> 00:48:18,430
That's pretty sweet.

1004
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:21,171

1005
00:48:21,171 --> 00:48:21,670
All right.

1006
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:25,900
Next one is what we
call orthostacks.

1007
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:29,960
These are like a stack of a
bunch of orthogonal polygons,

1008
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,170
a bunch of bands, basically.

1009
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:32,920
This is where the idea
of bands came from.

1010
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:37,046
This is from an old paper
in 1998, from the beginning.

1011
00:48:37,046 --> 00:48:38,670
So it's just I have
a band, and then, I

1012
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:39,850
stack another band on top.

1013
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:43,872
So each z cross-section
is connected.

1014
00:48:43,872 --> 00:48:45,080
So that's a little different.

1015
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,590
With towers, I could have
multiple towers here.

1016
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:50,904
I really only want one
tower built slab by slab.

1017
00:48:50,904 --> 00:48:52,820
These things we don't
know how to grid unfold.

1018
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:55,830
That's an open problem,
but if you refine just

1019
00:48:55,830 --> 00:49:00,860
in z by a factor of 2,
that's enough to unfold.

1020
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:03,190
So 1 by 2 refinement is
enough for orthostacks.

1021
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:12,340

1022
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:14,920
Now, you could go
a little crazier

1023
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,530
and allow vertex unfolding
of orthostacks with some grid

1024
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:23,920
refinement, and in that case,
you don't need any refinement.

1025
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,690
So grid vertex
unfolding orthostacks

1026
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:30,010
was the title of paper.

1027
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:33,070
These guys, John Iacono
and Stefan Langerman.

1028
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,550
And it looks
something like this.

1029
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:38,420
He uses vertex unfolding
to fix the direction.

1030
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:41,230
Here you were going up, but
you really wanted to go right.

1031
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:42,680
So it makes things easier.

1032
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:46,330
And in fact, the other
guys, Damian, Flatland,

1033
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:49,630
and O'Rourke-- It's got to
be awesome doing geometry

1034
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:54,530
and your last name is
Flatland, unless she

1035
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:56,990
does a lot of three
dimensional stuff.

1036
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:58,610
Irony.

1037
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:03,734
You can do vertex grid unfolding
of any orthogonal polyhedron

1038
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:04,900
is what I have written here.

1039
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,108
I haven't actually read that.

1040
00:50:06,108 --> 00:50:07,900
I should read that paper.

1041
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,150
What else do I have?

1042
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:11,270
Orthotubes.

1043
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:14,920
Orthotubes, this is
again in the old paper.

1044
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:20,090
Orthotube is just sort of
thickness one orthogonal tube.

1045
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:22,595
It could even be closed,
I think, in a loop,

1046
00:50:22,595 --> 00:50:24,820
but here I've shown it open.

1047
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,700
And here, grid
unfolding is enough.

1048
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,590
You just do all the
grid refinement.

1049
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:31,530
You could even
just do it locally.

1050
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:34,912
Technically,
there's a slice here

1051
00:50:34,912 --> 00:50:36,370
that might slice
over here, but you

1052
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:37,661
don't have to worry about that.

1053
00:50:37,661 --> 00:50:39,830
You just subdivide
into a bunch of boxes,

1054
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:44,750
and this can be unfolded in
a sort of zigzag fashion.

1055
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,350
So 1 by 1.

1056
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:48,120
You can generalize
this to trees also,

1057
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,610
though, it's not totally known.

1058
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:52,250
As long as you have
a tree of cubes

1059
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:56,370
with fairly long connectors
in between the branch points--

1060
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:59,490
those are called
well-separated orthotrees--

1061
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:01,590
that works grid unfolding.

1062
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:03,040
If you don't have
that condition,

1063
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,314
so just have cubes connect
in some treelike fashion,

1064
00:51:05,314 --> 00:51:07,230
it's open whether you
can do a grid unfolding.

1065
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,604
We've worked on
that in the past.

1066
00:51:08,604 --> 00:51:15,425
My conjecture's, in general,
you need to Omega(n) refinement.

1067
00:51:15,425 --> 00:51:24,330

1068
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:27,960
My belief is that this
kind of exponential blow

1069
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,220
up is necessary, but that you
can do it only a balance tree.

1070
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,589
So this would give
like linear refinement.

1071
00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:36,380
I think that's necessary,
but we can't even

1072
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:40,170
prove that you need 2 by 1
refinement in any example.

1073
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:43,710
We don't have anything where
grid unfolding is definitely

1074
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:45,690
impossible.

1075
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:49,130
It's quite sad state, I guess.

1076
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:52,440

1077
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,940
It's very hard to prove that
there aren't unfoldings, accept

1078
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:58,872
by exhaustive
enumeration, and that's

1079
00:51:58,872 --> 00:52:00,080
hard to do because it's slow.

1080
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:09,104

1081
00:52:09,104 --> 00:52:11,020
We've come up with lots
of candidate examples,

1082
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,870
but eventually, we
unfold them all.

1083
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:16,190

1084
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:20,930
I have a bunch of
other open problems.

1085
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:22,580
This was genus 0.

1086
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:27,120
Interesting question is can
you do genus higher than 0?

1087
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,170
Orthogonal polyhedra.

1088
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:32,030
I would guess so,
but I'm not sure.

1089
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:33,696
I think the biggest
question is, can you

1090
00:52:33,696 --> 00:52:34,940
make this non-orthogonal?

1091
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,350
But then, the bands get messy.

1092
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:39,161
Haven't been able to do that.

1093
00:52:39,161 --> 00:52:39,660
All right.

1094
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,667
I think those were
the main problems.

1095
00:52:41,667 --> 00:52:42,250
Any questions?

1096
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:45,460

1097
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,750
I'm going to take a
break from unfolding now

1098
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,840
and switch the other
direction of folding.

1099
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,600

1100
00:52:52,600 --> 00:53:09,195
So with folding, we're imagining
we're given some polygon,

1101
00:53:09,195 --> 00:53:11,070
and we'd like to make
a polyhedron out of it.

1102
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:14,340
It's exactly the reverse of
what we've been thinking about.

1103
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:17,230

1104
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:18,702
When is this possible?

1105
00:53:18,702 --> 00:53:21,160
Now, the rules of the game here
are different from origami.

1106
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,750
With origami, we
showed from any shape,

1107
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:26,850
you can make anything
if you scale it down.

1108
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:29,340
But here, I really
want exact coverage.

1109
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:33,860
Every point here, or let's
say every little patch here,

1110
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:37,300
should be covered by
exactly one layer over here,

1111
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,830
not allowing multiple layers.

1112
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:41,090
So this means not
everything is possible.

1113
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:43,450
I also care about
scale factor, but--

1114
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:45,690
This one, of course, you
can crease like this,

1115
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:49,100
and more importantly, you
glue these edges together.

1116
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,740
You glue these edges together.

1117
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:54,064
The opposite of
cutting is gluing.

1118
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,230
We'll be more formal about
defining gluing, I think,

1119
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:58,020
next lecture.

1120
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,310
This is just a sort of prelude.

1121
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:02,940
But you end up gluing--
I want to make something,

1122
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,780
let's say-- in
fact, we're always

1123
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:08,320
going to talk about
folding convex polyhedra.

1124
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:13,959
There's very little work
on the non-convex case,

1125
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,750
though, there was
actually a recent result.

1126
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,919
I'll mention that next lecture.

1127
00:54:18,919 --> 00:54:20,460
If you want to make
something convex,

1128
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,010
and therefore,
sphere-like, you have

1129
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:24,900
to get rid of all the
boundary, so you've got a glue

1130
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:25,427
every edge.

1131
00:54:25,427 --> 00:54:27,510
You don't have to glue
whole edges to whole edges.

1132
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:28,680
Maybe you just glue
part of an edge

1133
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,890
to another part of an
edge, but somehow, boundary

1134
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:32,150
has to get glued up.

1135
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:33,640
And if you want something
sphere-like, in fact,

1136
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,223
those gluings have
to be non-crossing.

1137
00:54:35,223 --> 00:54:37,630
I have to be able to
draw a picture like this.

1138
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:41,340
Question is when do these
gluings make a polyhedron?

1139
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:44,370
That is the question we will
be answering next class.

1140
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:47,430
But first question is suppose I
gave you one of these pictures.

1141
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:49,700
I give you a polygon,
and I give you a gluing.

1142
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:53,530
What this tells you is sort
of how to locally walk around.

1143
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:56,560
So if I'm here, I
could walk over here.

1144
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:00,580
I could walk over here, teleport
over there, walk over here,

1145
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,020
teleport over here.

1146
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:02,910
Whatever.

1147
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:03,410
OK?

1148
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:06,220
The gluing tells you locally
what the surface looks like,

1149
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,900
even though you don't know
what it looks like yet in 3D.

1150
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:12,820
In particular, you can
compute shortest paths here.

1151
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:15,420
I could compute the shortest
path from this point

1152
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:18,290
to this point you might
think is a straight line.

1153
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:20,450
But no, it's not.

1154
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:23,875

1155
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:24,660
I don't think.

1156
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,910
Or maybe it is.

1157
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:27,312
Let's see.

1158
00:55:27,312 --> 00:55:30,810
A little tricky.

1159
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:33,641
AUDIENCE: Should be diagonal
with the bottom square.

1160
00:55:33,641 --> 00:55:35,390
PROFESSOR: Diagonal
with the bottom square

1161
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:37,140
because these guys are
both in the bottom.

1162
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:37,730
Very good.

1163
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:43,320
So this point is the same as
this point, or no, this point.

1164
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,690
Because these get
zipped together.

1165
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:48,340
This point is the
same as this point,

1166
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:51,990
so in fact, that diagonal is the
shortest path between those two

1167
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:52,810
points.

1168
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:54,560
So you have to think
about it for a while,

1169
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,810
but it turns out, in polynomial
time, you can do that.

1170
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:59,390

1171
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:01,570
That's cool.

1172
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:08,170
What I want to show
now is that suppose

1173
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:10,360
you could make a convex
polyhedron in this way.

1174
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,870
I claim you can only make
one, never more than one

1175
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,940
from the same gluing.

1176
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,876
So I've defined locally
what this thing is.

1177
00:56:17,876 --> 00:56:19,000
It's like a piece of paper.

1178
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,210
I can mangle it around.

1179
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,260
If I want to make
something convex,

1180
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,320
there's only one thing
it could possibly make.

1181
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:30,790

1182
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:33,890
Finding out what that one
thing is quite a challenge,

1183
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:37,300
but at least, we can
prove that it's unique.

1184
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,425
Sorry about the screeching.

1185
00:56:38,425 --> 00:56:41,330

1186
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:44,690
This is Cauchy's
Rigidity Theorem.

1187
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:49,380
I think we mentioned it
in a previous lecture when

1188
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,766
we were talking about
rigidity and three dimensions

1189
00:56:51,766 --> 00:56:55,669
and like why domes stand up.

1190
00:56:55,669 --> 00:56:56,960
But now, we're going to use it.

1191
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,250
We're actually going
to prove this theorem,

1192
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:00,640
and we're going to use it to
study these kinds of gluings

1193
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,967
and say there's, at
most, one way to do this.

1194
00:57:03,967 --> 00:57:05,800
There's a lot of ways
to state this theorem,

1195
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:10,900
but one way is to say, suppose
you have two convex polyhedra,

1196
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,310
and suppose they came
from the same sort

1197
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:17,080
of intrinsic geometry.

1198
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,950
So there's the
geometry of the faces,

1199
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:22,560
and there's how they're
connected together.

1200
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,420
So here, initially,
I drew a tree

1201
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,480
of how the faces were
connected together,

1202
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,320
and then, I drew some other
connections like this.

1203
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,130
So the dual here is, of
course, an octahedron.

1204
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:36,460
But if you have two
convex polyhedra

1205
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,860
and they are combinatorally
equivalent, they

1206
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:41,070
have the same way that
things are connected

1207
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:51,210
together, the same graph, and
they have congruent faces,

1208
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:56,560
so the geometries
match also, then, they

1209
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:06,454
are actually the same
thing, the same polyhedron.

1210
00:58:06,454 --> 00:58:10,570
AUDIENCE: Is that
something that--

1211
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,637
PROFESSOR: Up to
rotation and translation.

1212
00:58:13,637 --> 00:58:16,717
AUDIENCE: Is it the same
set of congruent faces?

1213
00:58:16,717 --> 00:58:17,550
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

1214
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:19,091
So when I say
congruent faces, I mean

1215
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:20,650
according to this equivalence.

1216
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:22,100
If you take a face
on one that has

1217
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,750
a corresponding
face on the other,

1218
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,600
those two faces should be
congruent, not just any pair,

1219
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,360
and they're not all the same.

1220
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:29,880
Different faces
can be different,

1221
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,950
but they're identical in pairs.

1222
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:36,430
So I'm just saying basically,
if you have this picture,

1223
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:37,830
there's only one realization.

1224
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:40,950
So this picture defines what
are the geometry of the faces,

1225
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:43,310
how are they connected together.

1226
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:45,300
And so if you had
two convex polyhedra

1227
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,380
with that same
underlying diagram,

1228
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:49,390
they have to be the
same polyhedron.

1229
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:52,615
That's what we're claiming.

1230
00:58:52,615 --> 00:58:53,990
That's what we're
going to prove.

1231
00:58:53,990 --> 00:59:04,091

1232
00:59:04,091 --> 00:59:05,198
Is this one any better?

1233
00:59:05,198 --> 00:59:05,948
Yeah, it's better.

1234
00:59:05,948 --> 00:59:15,920

1235
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,870
This is an old theorem.

1236
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:21,320
You may have heard of Cauchy,
famous French mathematician.

1237
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,762
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
all those good things.

1238
00:59:23,762 --> 00:59:24,970
You don't need to know those.

1239
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:26,740
He proved a lot of things.

1240
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:28,980
This theorem he
didn't actually prove.

1241
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,380
He wrote a paper about it
or, I think, partly a letter,

1242
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:34,390
partly a paper in 1813.

1243
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:38,230
Proof was wrong, and
it was fixed in 1934,

1244
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:40,510
over 100 years
later, by Steinitz.

1245
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:44,380
So sometimes it's called
Cauchy-Steinitz Rigidity

1246
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,750
Theorem, although,
usually, Cauchy.

1247
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,616
There's a lemma in
here that's often

1248
00:59:48,616 --> 00:59:49,740
attributed to both of them.

1249
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:54,690

1250
00:59:54,690 --> 01:00:00,050
So it's sort of a
proof by contradiction.

1251
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:01,990
We want to prove uniqueness.

1252
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:03,920
So we're supposing,
well, maybe, there's

1253
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,010
two polyhedra, P and
P prime, and they're

1254
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:11,530
combinatory equivalent and
have matching faces congruent.

1255
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:14,870

1256
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:24,390
What I want to do is look
at corresponding vertices,

1257
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:30,260
let's say a vertex v of P and
a vertex v prime of P prime.

1258
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:34,670
So there corresponding in the
combinatorial equivalence.

1259
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:40,575
And then, I want to
slice the polyhedra, P

1260
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:49,320
and P prime, with
an epsilon sphere,

1261
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:55,030
epsilon radius sphere
centered at v and v prime.

1262
01:00:55,030 --> 01:01:01,960

1263
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,250
Quick mention, this
is not true if you

1264
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:06,000
allow non-convex realizations.

1265
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,270
You may have seen
that example before.

1266
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:11,410
These have exactly the same
combinatorial structure,

1267
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:14,324
same geometry on each
face, but one's non-convex,

1268
01:01:14,324 --> 01:01:15,240
and they're different.

1269
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,950
But as long as they're convex,
they're going to be the same.

1270
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:20,670
In a convex situation, here's
what the slice looks like.

1271
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:27,110
So here's little
vertex, degree like 5,

1272
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:29,860
and I slice the polyhedron
with this tiny sphere centered

1273
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:35,130
at v, not the interior, just
the boundary of the sphere.

1274
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:36,600
What I get are these arcs.

1275
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,630
They'll be great circular arcs.

1276
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:41,750
Here we can see
all five of them.

1277
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:43,110
They're great circular arcs.

1278
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:44,490
They're on the sphere.

1279
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:46,180
I get a polygon.

1280
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:48,480
I get a convex
polygon on the sphere.

1281
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:54,530

1282
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:57,966
Convex spherical
polygons, convex

1283
01:01:57,966 --> 01:01:59,340
because the
polyhedra are convex.

1284
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:00,630
I actually get two of them.

1285
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:01,130
Right?

1286
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:04,195
One for P, one for P prime.

1287
01:02:04,195 --> 01:02:04,695
Polygons.

1288
01:02:04,695 --> 01:02:07,460

1289
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:09,000
What do I know about
those polygons?

1290
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,550
I know they're edge lengths
because the length of an edge

1291
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:15,800
here is equal to-- if
this is a unit sphere,

1292
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,300
if I rescale the
epsilon to be 1,

1293
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:21,160
that edge length is
actually this angle.

1294
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:24,940
That angle is an angle of
the face at the vertex.

1295
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,186
So I know all the angles.

1296
01:02:26,186 --> 01:02:27,810
I know all the
geometries of the faces.

1297
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:29,320
I know they're congruent.

1298
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:33,630
So I know what these edge
lengths are in the sphere.

1299
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:36,580
What I don't know are these
angles of the polygon.

1300
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:38,350
I know the lengths
of the polygon,

1301
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:40,100
but I don't know the
angles of the polygon

1302
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:45,510
because that's essentially the
dihedral angle of that edge.

1303
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:48,110
And the worry is, well, maybe
all the edge lengths match.

1304
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:49,610
We could do this
at every vertex,

1305
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:51,570
but maybe the dihedral
angles are different.

1306
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:53,500
Maybe the convex
polyhedron could flex.

1307
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,220
That's why this
is about rigidity.

1308
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:57,250
Maybe it's flexible,
and then, maybe there

1309
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:59,416
are two different states.

1310
01:02:59,416 --> 01:03:01,790
All the faces are the same,
and therefore, all those edge

1311
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:05,144
lengths are the same, but
the angles might differ.

1312
01:03:05,144 --> 01:03:07,060
If P and P prime are
supposed to be different,

1313
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:09,940
then there must be two
angles that differ.

1314
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:12,830
So I want to look
at those angles,

1315
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:30,770
and I want to label vertex
of a spherical polygon.

1316
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:36,130
So I have n of these spherical
polygons for P, n of them

1317
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:37,400
for P prime.

1318
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,390
Let's look at them in P.

1319
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:47,280
I'm going to label it plus if
the angle there in P is bigger

1320
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,386
than the angle in P prime.

1321
01:03:50,386 --> 01:03:52,510
Remember I have a correspondence
between everything

1322
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:54,270
in P and everything and P prime.

1323
01:03:54,270 --> 01:04:00,464
Minus, if the angle is less,
and 0, if the angles are equal.

1324
01:04:00,464 --> 01:04:01,880
So what I want to
show is actually

1325
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,921
all the angles are equal.

1326
01:04:02,921 --> 01:04:05,310
Therefore, the polyhedra
will be identical.

1327
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:08,437
If all the faces are the same
and all the angles at which you

1328
01:04:08,437 --> 01:04:10,270
join them are the same
and they're connected

1329
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:12,186
in the same way, they
are the same polyhedron.

1330
01:04:12,186 --> 01:04:15,210
There's no flexibility
there, but it

1331
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:16,899
could be there are
pluses and minuses.

1332
01:04:16,899 --> 01:04:19,190
But if there's going to be
a problem with this theorem,

1333
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:20,689
there have to be
pluses and minuses.

1334
01:04:20,689 --> 01:04:22,670
That's the proof
by contradiction.

1335
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:24,299
So let's look at one of them.

1336
01:04:24,299 --> 01:04:26,590
Let's look at a vertex that
has some pluses or minuses.

1337
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:43,970

1338
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:46,760
So we have-- it's a
spherical polygon.

1339
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:53,020
I'm going to draw it more like
a polygon, maybe some pluses,

1340
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:56,660
some zeroes, some
minuses, whatever.

1341
01:04:56,660 --> 01:05:01,827
First question is could it
be all pluses and zeroes?

1342
01:05:01,827 --> 01:05:02,535
Is that possible?

1343
01:05:02,535 --> 01:05:09,130

1344
01:05:09,130 --> 01:05:11,845
No.

1345
01:05:11,845 --> 01:05:12,720
It doesn't look good.

1346
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,030
What does that mean?

1347
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:15,770
It would mean this
is like a linkage.

1348
01:05:15,770 --> 01:05:17,210
We're used to linkages.

1349
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:18,690
It just happens
to be on a sphere.

1350
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:19,760
Forget this on a sphere.

1351
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,574
Think of it is as almost flat.

1352
01:05:22,574 --> 01:05:24,490
What that would mean is
there's some other way

1353
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:25,646
to draw this thing.

1354
01:05:25,646 --> 01:05:27,520
Basically, there's a
way to flex this linkage

1355
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,820
so that all of these angles
increase and this one

1356
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:31,570
stays the same.

1357
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:34,880
How could I get a polygon
where all the angles increase

1358
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,110
and still be convex?

1359
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:38,360
Ain't possible.

1360
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,860
Why is it not possible?

1361
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:45,150
I think we've used this
fact a couple lectures ago.

1362
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,661
It's not possible by something
called the Cauchy Arm Lemma.

1363
01:05:47,661 --> 01:05:50,607

1364
01:05:50,607 --> 01:05:52,300
This is the part that
Cauchy got wrong,

1365
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:55,380
so it's also called the
Cauchy-Steinitz Arm Lemma.

1366
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:57,370
And here's the thing.

1367
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:04,030
If you have a convex
chain but open chain here.

1368
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:06,080
There's a missing bar.

1369
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,870
So suppose that even
when you add the bar,

1370
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:08,970
it's a convex polygon.

1371
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:11,240
But then, I take a convex
polygon, remove an edge.

1372
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:14,440
This is what we
call convex chain.

1373
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:20,780
And if you open all the angles,
increasing all the angles,

1374
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:33,625
in a convex chain, then
this distance increases.

1375
01:06:33,625 --> 01:06:41,544

1376
01:06:41,544 --> 01:06:42,460
It's pretty intuitive.

1377
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:45,160
I open all these angles.

1378
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,170
So I put plus.

1379
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:48,440
Some of them could
stay the same,

1380
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,965
but then, this
distance will increase,

1381
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:52,090
as long as you stay convex.

1382
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:54,770

1383
01:06:54,770 --> 01:06:56,090
I should mention that.

1384
01:06:56,090 --> 01:06:59,150
But in this situation, we know
that both the initial position

1385
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:01,625
in P and its target position
in P prime are both convex.

1386
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:07,920

1387
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:08,510
OK.

1388
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:11,000
Let's just take
that lemma as given.

1389
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,340
This is the one I don't like.

1390
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:24,750

1391
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:27,160
Then, I know, in particular,
I can't have all pluses

1392
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:32,030
because then, if I just pretend
one of these edges wasn't here,

1393
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:36,114
I know that that
distance must increase.

1394
01:07:36,114 --> 01:07:37,030
But it can't increase.

1395
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:38,321
It's supposed to stay the same.

1396
01:07:38,321 --> 01:07:39,870
The edge lengths are fixed.

1397
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:42,300
So if they're all pluses
and zeroes, or all minuses

1398
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,835
and zeroes, the same is true
just viewing P prime as P and P

1399
01:07:45,835 --> 01:07:48,509
as P prime.

1400
01:07:48,509 --> 01:07:49,550
They can't be all pluses.

1401
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:51,540
They can't be all minuses.

1402
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:53,680
So if there's anything in
there other than zeroes,

1403
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:57,040
there has to be at least one
plus, at least one minus.

1404
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:00,550
In particular, there have to
be at least two alternations.

1405
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:03,120

1406
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:06,890
Alternation is either going
from plus to minus or from minus

1407
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:08,300
to plus.

1408
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:09,853
So it could be
something like plus,

1409
01:08:09,853 --> 01:08:14,450
plus, plus, minus, minus,
minus, minus, plus, plus.

1410
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:15,550
Whatever.

1411
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:16,050
OK?

1412
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:18,899
Maybe that's your polygon,
and that's your labeling.

1413
01:08:18,899 --> 01:08:25,910

1414
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:26,690
Is that possible?

1415
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:30,589

1416
01:08:30,589 --> 01:08:32,630
So once you have at least
one plus and one minus,

1417
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:37,880
you have to have these
two switches at least.

1418
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,193
Could this happen?

1419
01:08:39,193 --> 01:08:40,160
AUDIENCE: No.

1420
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,870
PROFESSOR: No.

1421
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:43,450
Right.

1422
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:48,090
Because you pick some chord.

1423
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:51,502
What do I do here?

1424
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:52,500
Just subdivide.

1425
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:53,000
All right.

1426
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,390
Whatever.

1427
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:58,005
Pick some chord like this one.

1428
01:08:58,005 --> 01:08:59,005
I'm not sure it matters.

1429
01:08:59,005 --> 01:09:00,109
Maybe here?

1430
01:09:00,109 --> 01:09:02,520
Whatever.

1431
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,050
These angles down
here are decreasing.

1432
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:07,729
Therefore, this
distance decreases.

1433
01:09:07,729 --> 01:09:10,370
The angles up here
are all increasing.

1434
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:12,700
Therefore, this
distance increases.

1435
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:14,810
Can't have both.

1436
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:17,609
So this is also not possible.

1437
01:09:17,609 --> 01:09:20,267
So in fact, you have to have
at least four alternations.

1438
01:09:20,267 --> 01:09:20,975
It's always even.

1439
01:09:20,975 --> 01:09:26,520

1440
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:30,260
And so it has to be at least a
bunch of pluses, then a bunch

1441
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,410
of minuses, then a
bunch of pluses, then

1442
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:34,060
a bunch of minuses.

1443
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:37,410
And so we're counting these
transitions from plus to minus.

1444
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:40,880
This is a lemma that we used
when we were locking trees,

1445
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:41,500
I think.

1446
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,500
We had a convex polygon.

1447
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:45,154
I said at least two of the
angles have to decrease,

1448
01:09:45,154 --> 01:09:47,779
or at least two of them have to
increase, one way or the other.

1449
01:09:47,779 --> 01:09:50,960
That's because there have to be
at least two groups of pluses,

1450
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,882
not only at least two pluses
and at least two minuses.

1451
01:09:54,882 --> 01:09:56,340
You might think,
well, what happens

1452
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:58,965
if there's only three vertices.

1453
01:09:58,965 --> 01:10:00,840
Then, you can't have
these four alternations.

1454
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,950
Well, yeah, you can't have
those four alternation

1455
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:05,330
because if you have a
triangle, even on the sphere,

1456
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:06,740
triangles are rigid.

1457
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:11,417
So you would know if I had
a degree 3 vertex, locally

1458
01:10:11,417 --> 01:10:12,250
that thing is rigid.

1459
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,330
It can't flex at all.

1460
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:16,590
We're only interested in cases
where it might flex locally

1461
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:19,730
at a vertex like the pentagon,
like a quadrilateral.

1462
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:22,260

1463
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:23,050
All right.

1464
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:24,980
So what?

1465
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:30,110
This was true at every vertex
that was not entirely zero.

1466
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:35,307
So if we look at-- let
me write this down.

1467
01:10:35,307 --> 01:10:37,140
I really just care about
the non-zero edges,

1468
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:38,473
the ones that are plus or minus.

1469
01:10:38,473 --> 01:10:42,010

1470
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:51,020
So I'll call the subgraph
of plus and minus edges.

1471
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:53,980

1472
01:10:53,980 --> 01:11:01,982
The number of alternations
is at least 4 times

1473
01:11:01,982 --> 01:11:02,940
the number of vertices.

1474
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:09,583
I'm going to denote the number
of vertices by a capital V. OK?

1475
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:10,530
That's page one.

1476
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:13,170

1477
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:16,120
We're going to use a trick.

1478
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:17,620
It has many names, I suppose.

1479
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:20,500
I usually call it double
counting in combinatorics,

1480
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,000
where you have one
quantity, namely,

1481
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,083
the number of alterations.

1482
01:11:23,083 --> 01:11:25,330
We're going to count it
in two different ways.

1483
01:11:25,330 --> 01:11:26,955
We'll get two different
answers, but we

1484
01:11:26,955 --> 01:11:28,650
know they must end
up being the same.

1485
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:30,150
And then, we'll get
a contradiction.

1486
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:32,910

1487
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:35,260
So what's the second
way of counting.

1488
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:38,890
Well, we counted
local to a vertex.

1489
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:41,920
The other natural
way to count angles

1490
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,436
is by looking at the faces.

1491
01:11:43,436 --> 01:11:44,310
There are also faces.

1492
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:45,726
It's sort of the
dual perspective.

1493
01:11:45,726 --> 01:11:48,110
Every phase has a bunch of
angles that have some degree

1494
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:50,267
or whatever.

1495
01:11:50,267 --> 01:11:51,850
They're really kind
of the same thing.

1496
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:52,750
Oh, here was Cauchy's Arm Lemma.

1497
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:53,250
Beautiful.

1498
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:55,730

1499
01:11:55,730 --> 01:11:57,330
If you look at the
alternations as you

1500
01:11:57,330 --> 01:12:01,920
walk around a vertex versus
as you walk around a face,

1501
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,310
you'll end up counting
them the same number.

1502
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:04,810
Right?

1503
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:08,790
Here was an alternation
from plus to minus.

1504
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:10,357
What's interesting
here-- before we

1505
01:12:10,357 --> 01:12:11,940
were thinking of
labeling the vertices

1506
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:14,880
of the spherical polygon, but in
fact, whatever this edge does,

1507
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,800
it does the same thing local to
that vertex as the thing local

1508
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:18,520
to that vertex.

1509
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,140
So really the labels are
on the edges of the graph.

1510
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:23,530
They could be zero,
plus, or minus.

1511
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:26,160
And if I have an alternation
from plus to minus,

1512
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,210
view from the vertex,
it's also an alternation

1513
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:30,150
as I walk around the face.

1514
01:12:30,150 --> 01:12:32,300
So instead of counting
by walking around all

1515
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:34,716
the vertices-- which are just
did, and I got at least four

1516
01:12:34,716 --> 01:12:37,079
at every vertex-- let's
do it from the perspective

1517
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:37,620
of the faces.

1518
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:40,715

1519
01:12:40,715 --> 01:12:43,090
And we're in this weird subgraph
of plus and minus edges,

1520
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:44,370
so assume there are no zeroes.

1521
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:48,910

1522
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:49,410
All right.

1523
01:12:49,410 --> 01:13:01,610
If I have a face of 2 k
or 2 k plus 1 edges,

1524
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:08,000
then it will have, at most,
2 k alternations.

1525
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,210

1526
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:16,100
So I already have a lower
bound number of alternations.

1527
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,860
I'm going to try and
prove an upper bound,

1528
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:20,401
sandwich it between, and show
that, actually, the upper bound

1529
01:13:20,401 --> 01:13:23,350
is smaller than the lower bound,
and that's a contradiction.

1530
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:25,260
So this is kind of obvious.

1531
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:25,760
Right?

1532
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,850
If you have 2 k vertices, no
more than 2 k alternations,

1533
01:13:28,850 --> 01:13:31,270
slight, the place where we're
making a little improvement

1534
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:32,475
is for the odd case.

1535
01:13:32,475 --> 01:13:34,100
We know because a
number of alterations

1536
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:38,490
has to be even you can't get
up to 2 k plus 1 alternations.

1537
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:40,860
Has to be even because
for every plus to minus,

1538
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:43,720
there has to be a matching minus
to plus because it's cyclic.

1539
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,960
So even here, you can
only get 2 k alternations.

1540
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:50,170
That helps us a little
bit because now, we

1541
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:58,930
can talk about
number of alternation

1542
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:03,230
is at most two times
the number of triangles,

1543
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:07,820
f_3 is going to be the
number of faces of degree 3,

1544
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:13,510
plus 4 times the number
of quadrilaterals

1545
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:16,990
plus 4 times the
number of pentagons

1546
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:21,437
plus 6 times the number
of hexagons plus--

1547
01:14:21,437 --> 01:14:22,270
why'd I write seven?

1548
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:23,350
I wrote seven.

1549
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:25,650
I'm being sloppy.

1550
01:14:25,650 --> 01:14:27,360
At that point, I don't care.

1551
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:30,550
7 f 7, 8 f 8, 9 f
9-- I'm not going

1552
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:35,080
to try to be clever
from 6 on, but I'm

1553
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,770
going to be clever at 5 and 3.

1554
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:39,250
Why 5 and 3?

1555
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:40,830
As you may remember
from way back

1556
01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:43,660
when, you have a planar
graph-- because polyhedra

1557
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:44,690
are planar graphs.

1558
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:46,520
They're convex.

1559
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:53,200
The average degree is 5?

1560
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:57,180
Slightly under 6, 4, 3, 2, 1?

1561
01:14:57,180 --> 01:14:59,440
One of those numbers.

1562
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,580
Let's see.

1563
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:05,620
Should be like 3 n minus 6
edges, so that should be 3.

1564
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:08,525

1565
01:15:08,525 --> 01:15:10,100
Yeah, three.

1566
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:13,330
So most of the faces are
going to have low degree.

1567
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:14,080
That's the points.

1568
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,562
So 3 and 5 really
matter, but out here, it

1569
01:15:16,562 --> 01:15:17,520
doesn't matter so much.

1570
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:36,250

1571
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:38,660
This is kind of a magical proof.

1572
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:42,630
It shouldn't be intuitive
where it came from,

1573
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:43,940
but it's really beautiful.

1574
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:46,890
You'll see as it
all comes together.

1575
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:48,170
Fun.

1576
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:51,180
What do I do next?

1577
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:51,900
Right.

1578
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:55,500
I want to relate-- I
have a vertex count here.

1579
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:59,830
I have a face count here,
and I know Euler's formula.

1580
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:01,402
Hopefully, we know it.

1581
01:16:01,402 --> 01:16:02,235
It's a cool formula.

1582
01:16:02,235 --> 01:16:05,840

1583
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:06,850
V minus E plus F is 2.

1584
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:08,850
This is the number of
vertices, number of edges,

1585
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:11,130
number faces is two.

1586
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:15,994
For connected,
planar graphs.

1587
01:16:15,994 --> 01:16:18,410
There are other versions when
you have multiple components

1588
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:21,920
or when you have
tori, genus, whatever,

1589
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,430
but for convex
polyhedra, this is true.

1590
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:27,930
So this conveniently
relates vertices to faces,

1591
01:16:27,930 --> 01:16:30,290
but it involves edges.

1592
01:16:30,290 --> 01:16:33,116
So somehow, I have to
bring edges into the mix.

1593
01:16:33,116 --> 01:16:33,870
All right.

1594
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:38,430
Well, edges.

1595
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:40,690
I want to count
the number of edges

1596
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:43,167
in terms of the number of faces.

1597
01:16:43,167 --> 01:16:45,000
I could do it in terms
of vertices or faces.

1598
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,210
The number of edges
is half the sum

1599
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:48,810
of the degrees of the vertices.

1600
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:51,740
Remember, that's handshaking
lemma from way back when.

1601
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:56,700
It's also half the sum of
the degrees of the faces.

1602
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:59,670
If I look at every face and
I count the number of edges,

1603
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:02,060
I will end up counting
every edge twice, once

1604
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:07,015
from each side, so this is
half the number of faces.

1605
01:17:07,015 --> 01:17:09,740
Well, number faces I want
to write in this form.

1606
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:14,945
So this is half 2-- No, sorry.

1607
01:17:14,945 --> 01:17:15,820
Not the number faces.

1608
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:17,960
What am I doing?

1609
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,180
Half the sum of the
degrees of the faces.

1610
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:23,310

1611
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:28,190
So this is half-- what is
the degree of degree 3 faces?

1612
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:29,840
3.

1613
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,610
What is the degree
of degree 4 faces?

1614
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:32,381
4.

1615
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:32,880
And so on.

1616
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:41,295

1617
01:17:41,295 --> 01:17:41,795
Exactly.

1618
01:17:41,795 --> 01:17:45,067

1619
01:17:45,067 --> 01:17:46,900
So now, things are
starting to look similar,

1620
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:50,800
and I want to get some
cancellation going on.

1621
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,030
Use my cheat sheet here.

1622
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:55,620
I'm going to
rewrite this formula

1623
01:17:55,620 --> 01:18:02,330
as V equals 2 plus E minus F.
Hopefully, that's the same.

1624
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:03,770
I put E over here.

1625
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:04,995
I put F over there.

1626
01:18:04,995 --> 01:18:07,150
We'll get this.

1627
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:07,760
OK.

1628
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:12,290
So now, I have E
minus F. E is this.

1629
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:28,890
F-- I have F. Am I
missing something here?

1630
01:18:28,890 --> 01:18:30,930
I'll write the
next one, and I'll

1631
01:18:30,930 --> 01:18:32,180
figure out where it came from.

1632
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:52,300

1633
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:55,190
Oh, duh, I just skipped a step.

1634
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:59,120
F is the sum of f_3 plus
f_4 plus f_5 plus f_6.

1635
01:18:59,120 --> 01:18:59,715
OK?

1636
01:18:59,715 --> 01:19:02,520
All I did here was
decrease by-- well,

1637
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:05,040
because there's a half out here,
I decrease each coefficient

1638
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,704
by 2, nothing surprising.

1639
01:19:08,704 --> 01:19:10,970
Whew!

1640
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:16,110
So I took E, I subtracted F,
just took away one of each.

1641
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:17,170
Now, I have this formula.

1642
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:18,190
That's V.

1643
01:19:18,190 --> 01:19:23,350
Now, I also know
that 4V is at most,

1644
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:26,038
the number of alternations.

1645
01:19:26,038 --> 01:19:26,930
Hm.

1646
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:28,791
So I could get a
formula for 4V here.

1647
01:19:28,791 --> 01:19:29,290
Right?

1648
01:19:29,290 --> 01:19:35,730
4V is going to be 8 plus
this is going to be like 2.

1649
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:43,170
So I get 2 f_3 plus-- oh
boy, 1 times-- 4 times f_4

1650
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:47,390
plus-- just double
these numbers-- 6 times

1651
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:50,490
f_5 plus-- what's the next one?

1652
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:54,310
4-- 8 times f_6, and so on.

1653
01:19:54,310 --> 01:20:03,970

1654
01:20:03,970 --> 01:20:05,740
Yes.

1655
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:06,290
OK.

1656
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:15,120
Now, these guys look very
similar to these guys.

1657
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:18,060

1658
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:19,601
Now, here it gets bigger.

1659
01:20:19,601 --> 01:20:20,100
8.

1660
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:23,170
It's going to go 10,
instead of 6 and 7.

1661
01:20:23,170 --> 01:20:24,580
We also have a plus 8.

1662
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:27,160
We don't know whether there
any faces of degree 6 or more,

1663
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:29,290
so we can't rely on
that, but we have plus 8.

1664
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:32,902
So somehow, 4V,
which is, at most,

1665
01:20:32,902 --> 01:20:34,360
the number of
alternations-- that's

1666
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,570
the reverse of what
we said before-- 4V

1667
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:38,470
is, at most, this
number, and yet, it's

1668
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:40,170
also equal to this number.

1669
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:41,120
It can't be both.

1670
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,180
This number's at least 8
larger than this number.

1671
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:45,880
It could be even more
larger, but at least

1672
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:48,820
that contradiction done.

1673
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:51,250
This works as long as
there's at least one face,

1674
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:53,810
meaning there's at
least 1 plus or minus

1675
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:56,200
because we're only looking at
the subgraph plus and minus

1676
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:57,030
edges.

1677
01:20:57,030 --> 01:20:58,820
And that is Cauchy's
Rigidity Theorem.

1678
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:04,444
Let me quickly tell
you in our situation,

1679
01:21:04,444 --> 01:21:06,110
here, we don't actually
necessarily know

1680
01:21:06,110 --> 01:21:07,026
where the creases are.

1681
01:21:07,026 --> 01:21:09,802
We just know how things
are glued together.

1682
01:21:09,802 --> 01:21:11,510
Even in that situation,
you could sort of

1683
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:14,390
figure out where the creases
must be because as I said,

1684
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:16,860
you can compute shortest paths
once you have the gluing.

1685
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:17,940
So you compute
the shortest paths

1686
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:20,398
between all pairs of vertices,
something like this picture,

1687
01:21:20,398 --> 01:21:22,540
except you don't know
what it looks like in 3D.

1688
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:24,248
You can still compute
the shortest paths.

1689
01:21:24,248 --> 01:21:26,530
You know every edge
must be a shortest path.

1690
01:21:26,530 --> 01:21:29,160
So the edges are some
subset of these guys.

1691
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:33,000
And so you've got lots of
little convex polygons here.

1692
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,860
We know it must make
a convex polyhedron.

1693
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:38,210
If it made two, Cauchy's
Rigidity Theorem

1694
01:21:38,210 --> 01:21:39,830
would tell you that
they're the same.

1695
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:41,590
So even once you
fix the gluing, you

1696
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:46,090
know that there's a
unique convex realization,

1697
01:21:46,090 --> 01:21:49,210
and there will be a unique
set of edges from the shortest

1698
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:50,840
paths that actually realize it.

1699
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,684
The next class will
be all about how

1700
01:21:52,684 --> 01:21:55,100
to actually find those gluings
and know that they actually

1701
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:57,790
will fold into some convex shape
and how to find that convex

1702
01:21:57,790 --> 01:22:01,380
shape, but that's it for today.
