0-1:59:57,500 --> 00:00:03,386

2
00:00:03,386 --> 00:00:04,760
PROFESSOR: So for
today's lecture

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,810
we have Jason Ku
guest lecturing.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,290
And he's the president of
OrigaMIT, which you should all

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,860
check out Sunday afternoons,
origami club at MIT.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,972
He's an origami designer
and a grad student

7
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:17,430
in mechanical
engineering, and he's

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,670
going to talk about the more
artistic perspective on how

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,410
origami design
works, in particular

10
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,440
in the representational and tree
method of origami design world.

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,188
So take it away, Jason.

12
00:00:29,188 --> 00:00:29,729
JASON KU: Hi.

13
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:32,590
I'm Jason.

14
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,090
Erik gave a bit of
an introduction.

15
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,890
I've been folding
origami instance maybe

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,080
I was five years old,
and I've been designing

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,680
origami for maybe
the past 10 years.

18
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,100
I'm a PhD student in
mechanical engineering,

19
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,240
working in folding things
on the micro and nano scale.

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,840
So that's how this is
applying to my research.

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,960
I'm here to talk a little
bit about origami art

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,470
and how the concepts we've
been talking about in class

23
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:12,640
apply to origami in actually
designing and folding

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,120
artwork out of paper.

25
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,670
These are all the
websites that I'm

26
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,670
going to be pulling
pictures from.

27
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,940
So if we can't
use these pictures

28
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,960
in future versions
of this lecture,

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,330
then you can still
see some of the media.

30
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:37,850
I want first make the analogy
of origami art to music.

31
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,730
Many, many people
make this analogy,

32
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,070
and it's actually
very apt analogy.

33
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,290
In music you have
composers, you have

34
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:58,950
people who produce a work of
music, design the structure,

35
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,350
design what the main
aspects of the piece

36
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,639
are, in terms of a
structural sense,

37
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:08,220
but aren't necessarily
performers themselves.

38
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,880
Now in origami, the
performer and the composer

39
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,130
are usually one and the same.

40
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:18,610
But hopefully in the future,
that won't always be the case.

41
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,475
In music the composer
usually makes

42
00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:27,280
a piece for multiple instruments
or multiple voices or things

43
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,527
like that, so most the time
can't do all that performance.

44
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,860
And some people are more
gifted in the performance side.

45
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,480
Some people are more gifted
in the composition side.

46
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,870
And I think it's a
fairly apt analogy.

47
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,060
There's tons of
mathematics in music.

48
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,850
There's tons of
mathematics in origami.

49
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:51,390
But there's also this level
of artistic complexity, which

50
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,140
we'll see later in this lecture.

51
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,210
I'm going to concentrate mostly
on representational origami.

52
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,560
Representational
origami is traditionally

53
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,020
representing living
things in our world,

54
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,890
but it's pretty much, you
see something not necessarily

55
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,710
living, but you see
something and you

56
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,080
want to make that form
for the form's sake,

57
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,790
to represent that form.

58
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,250
And this is different
than, say, patterning

59
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:24,660
to create artistic patterns
on a sheet of paper,

60
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,410
tessellating, making
geometric polyhedra,

61
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:35,560
or making more abstract art
that doesn't necessarily

62
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,080
have a relation to
a real world object.

63
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,900
So I'm going to start with a
little bit about origami art.

64
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,880
We've heard this.

65
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:49,606
Erik mentioned this particular
individual, Akira Yoshizawa.

66
00:03:49,606 --> 00:03:55,310
He is widely understood to be
the father of modern origami.

67
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,840
He was born in 1911.

68
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,520
He was around for
a very long time.

69
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,080
Unfortunately,
passed away in 2005.

70
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,100
I was lucky enough to get
to meet Akira Yoshizawa when

71
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,640
he attended a convention
in North Carolina

72
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,750
when I was maybe around 10.

73
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:19,820
He was very powerful
and influential

74
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,970
in the world of origami, because
he was one of the first people

75
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:30,630
to start creating new models,
be able to look at an object

76
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:35,390
and create that object
just from folding.

77
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,800
He was one of the first
people to actually try

78
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,950
to make a large
number of new models,

79
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,580
as opposed to the
past many centuries

80
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,940
when only a few traditional
models were known or pursued.

81
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,610
This is a picture of
Yoshizawa right here.

82
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,760
He's fairly happy
in this picture.

83
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,300
But he's holding the logo
of the US organization

84
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,270
in origami, OrigamiUSA,
which is this sailboat.

85
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,970
But as you can see, different
than the traditional origami

86
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,290
crane or the frog or
things like that, you

87
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,820
see a lot of curves in his
work, a lot of shaping.

88
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,910
He uses a technique called
wet-folding, in which he

89
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,270
weakens the paper
to some degree,

90
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,210
weakens the paper fibers
by applying water, shaping

91
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,670
the paper, and letting it dry
so that it holds that form.

92
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:41,630
And you can see in this
sparrow-- this is particularly

93
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,780
one of my favorite
works by Yoshizawa--

94
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,370
it really has the essence
of this little bird,

95
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,690
but is actually very
simple and elegant.

96
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,180
Origami design isn't
all about making

97
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,130
the most complex
thing in the world.

98
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:02,250
It's really trying to
represent a subject elegantly.

99
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,430
And I think this model does
a very good job with that.

100
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:12,160
But you can see here, very
clean surfaces, not a lot

101
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,660
of extra creases
that you can see.

102
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,950
Traditionally, wet-folding
uses thicker paper

103
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,325
and is slightly
more substantial.

104
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:25,480

105
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,600
So here are some
of his other works.

106
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,520
And I want to start
out with Yoshizawa

107
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,270
because he was represented
as the father and the master,

108
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,970
and many, many of the
origami designers,

109
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,580
if not all of the origami
designers that I'm

110
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,080
going to continue to
talk about were heavily

111
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,130
influenced by Yoshizawa.

112
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,420
So I'm going to first talk
about the traditional style.

113
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:58,190
And I'm going to compare it
to, say, the crane or the frog.

114
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,970
These types of models are
characterized by straight,

115
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:07,110
well-defined, polygons
in the final form,

116
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,040
typically folded flat.

117
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,000
Little shaping is
traditionally needed

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,610
to go from the base of the
model to the final form.

119
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,730

120
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,540
It's very geometric,
these models,

121
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:31,100
characterized by very
straight, precise creases.

122
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,720
So here is, I think,
a very good example

123
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,720
of this traditional style.

124
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,700
While there are
some curves here,

125
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,940
everything is very
well-defined, maybe

126
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,760
just a slight shaping here.

127
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,570
But even that is
fairly well-defined.

128
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:57,320
But you can see Komatsu, Hideo
Komatsu, a Japanese folder,

129
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:03,950
uses really clean, large
polygons of open paper

130
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,150
without creases on them
to represent polygons

131
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,190
on the model.

132
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,560
The folded form.

133
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,280
His design process isn't
really using tree theory.

134
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,960
I mean, all origami design
is subjected to the condition

135
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,970
that no two points on
the unfolded square

136
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,900
can increase in distance
in the folded form.

137
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:34,539
That's a property called
developability of the paper.

138
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:38,460
The paper's not going
to stretch, basically.

139
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,210
So all origami design is
subject to that condition,

140
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,300
but you don't have to deal with
necessarily these things called

141
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,550
uniaxial bases.

142
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:51,050
Pretty much all of these
models are non-uniaxial.

143
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,010
His design process is
kind of a trial and error

144
00:08:54,010 --> 00:09:01,260
process of folding along
different 22.5 degree grids.

145
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:10,300
22.5 degrees is, I
guess, 1/8 of pi.

146
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,080
1/16 of 360 degrees.

147
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,660
And it's a particularly nice
and useful discretization

148
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,400
of angles in origami design.

149
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,780
All the traditional bases are
based on this 22.5 degree grid

150
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,270
system.

151
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,050
And there's a certain
elegance of that.

152
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,530
Actually I think, the mouse
is based on a 30 degree grid

153
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:39,900
system, but is kind
of an exception,

154
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,810
but follows the same principles.

155
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:46,660
He keeps folding
a piece of paper

156
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:52,300
and tries to get these
geometric shapes that really

157
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,080
are able to by themselves
capture the model.

158
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,210
And I'm going to use some
of that design technique

159
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,190
later in a design example.

160
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,120
He has a small but
very distinguished

161
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:15,870
repertoire because his process
is less algorithmic-- I mean,

162
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:22,600
he has algorithms, I'm sure,
that are difficult to describe,

163
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,020
but his process is
actually very artistic.

164
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,340
And while it's
very exact, I think

165
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:36,030
it's one of the most elegant
examples of origami design.

166
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,430
Here's another example
of the traditional style.

167
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,790
As you can see, there's slightly
more curves and things in it,

168
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:49,140
but it's fairly
well characterized

169
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,420
by these straight creases.

170
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:58,070
Heavier paper for wet-folding.

171
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,870
This model on the left
here is box pleated.

172
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:06,060
So as opposed to the
22.5 degrees structure,

173
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,890
box pleating is characterized
by only multiples of 45 degrees.

174
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,660
So pi over 4.

175
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,570

176
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:22,200
And so you see the
grid here, this model

177
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,360
is based on a fairly
large grid, so you

178
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,010
can get the detail
that it needs.

179
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,520

180
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,730
These are not
uniaxial bases, again,

181
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,580
but they're still limited
by this stretch ability

182
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,330
constraint.

183
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:43,120
And those were
styles that stemmed

184
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,790
from the traditional
crisp folding of say

185
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,660
the crane and the crab
and the frog and all

186
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,140
these traditional designs.

187
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,860
The non-traditional
style is more

188
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,724
an extension of Yoshizawa's work
and shaping and curved folding

189
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:01,890
and things like wet-folding.

190
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,600

191
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,020
There is much shape
that needs to be

192
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,470
done to create the
essence of the model.

193
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,190

194
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:20,640
The model is encapsulated by
not necessarily the structure

195
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:26,100
as much, but of the final
shaping, the undefined shaping

196
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,790
that you kind of
put into the model.

197
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,660
Here's an example
of an English folder

198
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,730
named David Brill, who
is an investment banker,

199
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,200
if my memory serves me.

200
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,570
He now lives on a golf course.

201
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:46,350
And I think he's retired now,
but he likes to fold paper.

202
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:51,860
But you can see
here, a good example

203
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,210
of this style, thick paper.

204
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:01,030

205
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,660
The character of
the model is really

206
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:09,760
defined by these curved
tension folds, which

207
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,270
is slightly different than at
least the traditional style.

208
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:20,350
And oftentimes, it's
very, very difficult

209
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,840
to replicate to any of
these types of models,

210
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:31,290
because it has so much to do
with subjectivity as opposed

211
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,860
to objectivity, as in
the traditional style.

212
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,590
Here's another good
example, Michael LaFosse.

213
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:45,010
He's a paper folder who actually
resides here in Massachusetts.

214
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,800
He's in Haverhill,
"Have-er-ill,"

215
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,400
something like
that, Massachusetts.

216
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,810
He is unique in origami
designers in the fact

217
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:59,440
that he is also an
avid paper maker.

218
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,480
So he actually makes a lot
of the media which he folds.

219
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,590
And that gives this
intimate relationship

220
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,980
between the life
cycle of the paper.

221
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,280

222
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,830
He's able to make
specialty paper that's

223
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,730
really necessary to make some
of the most complex works

224
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,290
out there.

225
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,400

226
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,030
He's gone to culinary school.

227
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,010
He was a chef for a while.

228
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:33,210
And he was also a marine
biologist for a while.

229
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:36,470
So these origami
artists have come

230
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,800
from many different
walks of life.

231
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:47,290
This next folder, Eric
Joisel, he's a Frenchman,

232
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,140
lives in Paris.

233
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,280
He was a former clay sculptor.

234
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,000
And actually, I think you can
really see that in his work,

235
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:02,970
the kind of solidness
and really cohesiveness

236
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,640
of his composition.

237
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:11,990
All the detail and
texturing are very well

238
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,747
thought out in terms of the
subject as a complete piece.

239
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:17,080
Heavily influenced by Yoshizawa.

240
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,331

241
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:25,100
A lot of this use of texture,
incorporating texture

242
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:30,770
into his models, he was a
big pioneer in that area.

243
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,360

244
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,570
This texturing is fairly
obviously non-uniaxial.

245
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,140
He doesn't go
through a tree method

246
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,670
and represent each
one of these points

247
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,180
as a stick in a stick figure.

248
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,140

249
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,450
These flaps don't
lie along an axis.

250
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,380
They don't hinge
perpendicular to that axis.

251
00:15:53,380 --> 00:16:00,090
Yet he's able to create
these amazing forms in paper.

252
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,440
He has stopped
doing clay sculpture

253
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,580
and does origami full time now.

254
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:11,030
He's very well known for his
depiction of the human form.

255
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:15,190
This is taken from a
collection of masks.

256
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,480
He's done numerous,
numerous masks

257
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,600
that are really very expressive.

258
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,340
He was one of the first people
to really, for me at least,

259
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:32,990
evoke emotion and convey
emotion in his work.

260
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:38,080
But you can see here, the
structural crease pattern

261
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,840
for this face is actually
very, very simple.

262
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,920
It's kind of represented
by a few pleats.

263
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:50,120
But the amount of work used to
transform that very simple form

264
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,290
into this very expressive,
curved work of art

265
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,700
is kind of astonishing.

266
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,630

267
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:03,710
Here's a more recent work
of the entire human form.

268
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:13,630
You see how this is starting
to come as some sort of blend

269
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,869
between the traditional
and nontraditional forms.

270
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,609
It lies somewhere
along the spectrum.

271
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:22,420
But it's a very
complex model, so it

272
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,740
had needs to have this
structural complexity.

273
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,340
But at the same time, he
shapes it to an extent

274
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,460
that very few people can do.

275
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,600

276
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,670
I'm paraphrasing a
quote of his, but he's

277
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:45,050
of the opinion that
if you can reproduce

278
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:50,060
exactly a piece of origami
then it's not really art,

279
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:55,690
because you're not putting
anything more into the model,

280
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,550
if it doesn't have something
unique and original

281
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:03,830
and something that can't
be reproduced in the model.

282
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:09,790
Here's two fantastic subjects
in terms of art, to me.

283
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:15,870
Very Escher-like and
it's self-referencing.

284
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,920
This is called
the Self-made Man.

285
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,460
And I forget the
title of this work,

286
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,550
but he's basically
emerging from the paper.

287
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:28,740
You see that his arm and leg
are not actually finished.

288
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,410
I think this is called
Birth, actually.

289
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,180

290
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:39,140
But really, using paper to
express an artistic idea,

291
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,220
very few people get to
that stage of competency

292
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:48,270
with the technical and
being able to infuse

293
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,750
that emotion into the subject.

294
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:56,570
So Eric Joisel is a pioneer
in that realm of origami art.

295
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:01,390
Here are three
very, very complex--

296
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,240
These are very recent
works, probably

297
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,340
within the last year or two.

298
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:12,700
Lots of use of texturing
to make the armor here.

299
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,090
Lots of planning,
tree theory included.

300
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,810
These are mostly
box pleated models,

301
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:20,010
but you can't really
tell from here because

302
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:27,260
of his impeccable
ability to shape a model.

303
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm going to remind you
guys that everything

304
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,730
I'm showing to you is a
representational work.

305
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,750
Each one of these is made
from a single uncut square.

306
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,640

307
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,880
Pretty much, I
believe everything

308
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,007
I'm going to show you
today has that property.

309
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:47,492
AUDIENCE: When people fold
these, do they fold them

310
00:19:47,492 --> 00:19:49,480
by hand or do they
need special tools?

311
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,965
To me, this looks like
it would be completely

312
00:19:51,965 --> 00:19:53,456
impossible to just
fold it by hand.

313
00:19:53,456 --> 00:19:58,821

314
00:19:58,821 --> 00:20:00,820
JASON KU: These are
actually fairly large works.

315
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,050
Each one stands maybe
about that tall.

316
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:07,120
So the paper's very
large to begin.

317
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,640
But yeah, I believe
he just uses his hands

318
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,790
and this wet-folding
technique to allow

319
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,590
things to be held in place.

320
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:18,640
I mean, many people, including
Eric Joisel, use clips

321
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,590
and braces and things like that
to hold certain things in place

322
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,490
while he's working on
other areas of the model,

323
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,810
but it's pretty much by hand.

324
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,840
Some people use tweezers
or things like that.

325
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,570
But most of it is by hand.

326
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,930
AUDIENCE: Does he add color
or shade or those things?

327
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,750
JASON KU: Sometimes.

328
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,660
For example, that mask I
think was speckled with paint

329
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,590
after, before or after.

330
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,390

331
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:52,640
There are different opinions
on this idea of origami purity.

332
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,350

333
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,990
I like Robert Lang's
definition of origami,

334
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:08,540
that it's any work
whose primary structure

335
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,050
is defined by folding.

336
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:15,040
And that's a very broad
definition of origami.

337
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,320
But I think it
works really well.

338
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:23,900
So if the subject matter is
still heavily characterized

339
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,320
by the folding and
not some other thing

340
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,600
that you do to
the model, I think

341
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,900
most people are OK with
that, as long as you're not

342
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,150
trying to pass it off
as something it's not.

343
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,860

344
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,950
There are many origami designers
to do multi-sheet things

345
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:49,510
and do very complex works and
very beautiful pieces of art.

346
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:53,250
I think Joseph Wu is a
great example of this,

347
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,020
who I don't have
pictures of his work.

348
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:00,770
But he doesn't try to pass them
off a single sheet origami.

349
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,180
He is a very skilled designer.

350
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,880
He could do it with
a single sheet,

351
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,880
but he finds that the
solution is more elegant

352
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,297
using multiple sheets.

353
00:22:08,297 --> 00:22:09,130
Any other questions?

354
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,770

355
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:15,920
Just one more picture of
some of Joisel's work.

356
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:21,610
He actually made an entire
orchestra of these little guys.

357
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:22,630
This is two sheets.

358
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,800
The saxophone is
a different sheet.

359
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,755
But again, he's not
trying to pass them off

360
00:22:28,755 --> 00:22:37,940
as being the same sheet here,
whereas in here, the weapons

361
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:43,250
actually are from the
same sheet of paper.

362
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:47,370
And these multi-subject
pieces, each one of these, it's

363
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,230
not all three of them
together as one sheet.

364
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,240
Just to clarify.

365
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,380
But these multi-subject,
trying to represents

366
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,410
clothes, and weapons,
and the human,

367
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:03,200
and all these types of things,
is becoming more and more a way

368
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,390
to a push the limits
of origami design.

369
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:11,000
So again, trying to breathe life
into the paper is really what

370
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,330
Yoshizawa's mantra was,
and so is Eric Joisel's.

371
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:16,830
All right.

372
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:25,280
So I'm going to move on to this
independent concept of really

373
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,490
the ability that
we have right now

374
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:33,050
to pretty much-- We have the
algorithms to make anything

375
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,330
we want and really
trying to capture

376
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:41,075
that is this idea that I
call this modern realism.

377
00:23:41,075 --> 00:23:44,960

378
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:52,290
The style, like
Eric Joisel's work,

379
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,200
kind of follow
along the spectrum

380
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:01,120
of this rigid structure
and this free-form shaping,

381
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:07,090
but really try to capture
this realism of the subject.

382
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:11,540
So I think Robert Lang is
one of the foremost origami

383
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,190
designers in this kind of area.

384
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:18,500
He's a guy from
California who is

385
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,550
a pioneer of algorithmic
origami design.

386
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,040
You've heard his name
a number of times.

387
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,600

388
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,100
He has kind of
codified tree theory,

389
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,540
if not one of the
pioneers of establishing

390
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,450
that research himself.

391
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:40,030
He wrote the program TreeMaker
that you guys are all probably

392
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:42,630
using to do your homework.

393
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:50,020
He was at Caltech Ph.D., and
was a laser physicist for NASA.

394
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,550
And he decided maybe
less than 10 years ago

395
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:58,240
to quit and do
origami full time.

396
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,400
So that's what he does now.

397
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,930

398
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,780
So here's a number of his works.

399
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:08,020
Very complex, very exact.

400
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:14,220
For example, he
was a huge pioneer

401
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,480
of what we call the Bug Wars.

402
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,990
When we had these
tools at our disposal

403
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:25,840
to make very complex
trees, we can

404
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,580
represent very, very
complex subjects.

405
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,400
And that led to this Bug
Wars of trying to one-up

406
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,870
each other on how many legs you
could make or things like that.

407
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,130
So here's a centipede,
for example,

408
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,110
with lots and lots of legs.

409
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:47,050
And the exactness to which
we can specify the tree

410
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,050
is phenomenal.

411
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:53,180
For example, the
scorpion here is a design

412
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,950
that Robert Lang
has approached--

413
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:00,040
a subject he's approached--
many, many, many times.

414
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,410
This is a design that
I particularly like.

415
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:09,830
It's very clean in its folded
and its structural forms.

416
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:13,950
But he actually used
TreeMaker and designed

417
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,580
each of these pairs
of legs to actually

418
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,850
be increasing in
length as they go back.

419
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:25,370
So really being very
exact with the proportions

420
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:28,290
of the model, the
proportions in the tree.

421
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,230
And tree theory
really allows you

422
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,780
to do that, to capture that.

423
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,020
Here's a slide for the
mathematicians in here.

424
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,100
This is not one
square sheet of paper.

425
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,570
This is probably the only
model here that isn't.

426
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:50,690
But it's what we call modular
origami, making a single unit

427
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:54,370
and sticking them all together
in a very complex and elegant

428
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:54,880
way.

429
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,150
Here's a representation of
some of the tessellation work

430
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,400
that Robert Lang
has been working on.

431
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,950

432
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:10,300
This is a vase form.

433
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,710
And all these, or at
least these three,

434
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:18,380
were very much characterized
by using mathematics

435
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,570
to find these forms.

436
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:23,700
And while they're very
heavily rooted in mathematics.

437
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,880
Mathematics, as I'm sure
all of us can appreciate,

438
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,340
is an elegant subject
in and of itself.

439
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,420
There are elegant
solutions to problems.

440
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,590
And in origami it's
particularly nice,

441
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:38,900
because these elegant
solutions often

442
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,340
are very elegant and
pleasing to the eye, as well.

443
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,130
So this is also a Klein bottle.

444
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,190
It's kind of a joke.

445
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:51,110
But it topologically does
intersect and things like that.

446
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:55,000
So in an interesting work.

447
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,810
I want to move on to a
guy named Brian Chan, who

448
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,770
is an alumni of MIT.

449
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:06,060
He got his bachelor's, his
master's, and his Ph.D. at MIT.

450
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:10,920
He defended his Ph.D.
in 2009, but he's still

451
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,010
around Cambridge.

452
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:19,730
He is a big pioneer of pushing
the limits of complex folding.

453
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:24,110
He's picked up origami
design very quickly.

454
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,540
And so it is possible to do.

455
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,770
So I encourage all
of you to try it.

456
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:33,910
Here is an example of a very,
very complex centipede that he

457
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,385
designed kind of in
response to Robert Lang's.

458
00:28:37,385 --> 00:28:40,460

459
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:51,140
There's a huge history
of really trying

460
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,260
to one-up each other in origami.

461
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:57,590
And it really helps
spur the creativity.

462
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:03,470
And playful competition is
very useful to any subject.

463
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,200
These multi-subject
things, like this

464
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,010
rose, the stem and
the petals itself,

465
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,110
all from one square
sheet of paper.

466
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,890
He uses color change.

467
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,550
One side of the paper is red;
one side of the paper is green.

468
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:22,256

469
00:29:22,256 --> 00:29:24,380
There have been tons of
people that design just the

470
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,610
rose part of the rose, and then
they make an additional stem

471
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,860
and stick it on.

472
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,780
This is the first
one-piece model of that.

473
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:36,640
And was somewhat
influential in that respect.

474
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,700
Here's a very complex,
textured character

475
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,290
from an anime TV show.

476
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,620
I forget which one it's called.

477
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,600
AUDIENCE: Rozen Maiden.

478
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,250
JASON KU: Rozen
Maiden Thank you.

479
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,240
That is correct.

480
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,910
But you really can see his
use of color change here.

481
00:29:51,910 --> 00:30:00,480
Again, being able to make
this cross in the fabric here.

482
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:07,950
The zigzags of lace, and
this texturing of the dress,

483
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:13,060
very, very complex, in its form.

484
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:17,350
But these are all
actually uniaxial bases,

485
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,330
all come from this
idea of tree theory,

486
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:24,020
being able to map
things on your subject

487
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,830
to the sheet of paper
in an algorithmic way.

488
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:33,900
Here's a very complex, another
anime work, a Neko Bus.

489
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,980
Neko is, I believe,
Japanese for cat.

490
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,470
And it's very, very complex.

491
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,500
Again, similar to the centipede.

492
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,430
Lots and lots of points.

493
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:46,280
But this tree is actually
kind of represented

494
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,760
by-- There's a head
region and there's

495
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,130
many points sticking
out on both sides.

496
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:57,030
And then this flap kind of
comes over and attaches up here,

497
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,140
and you've got the tail.

498
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:05,170
Here's another example
of a multi-subject model.

499
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,030
Every year there's
a design challenge

500
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,110
in New York for origami.

501
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:12,700
And this was the
sailing ship category.

502
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,240
And he kind of went
another direction with it.

503
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,810
He did make a sailing
ship, but this

504
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:22,040
is a giant squid, a kraken,
attacking the ship.

505
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,660
He's got a little person
in one of his tentacles.

506
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,200
Part of the ship
and the ship itself,

507
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,450
and it's all one square sheet
of paper without cutting.

508
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:36,890
And if that wasn't enough,
then the MIT seal, as well.

509
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,640
One square sheet of
paper without cutting.

510
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,460
The mens et manus,
the mind and hand.

511
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:51,330
And I believe this isn't
traditionally a crane,

512
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,570
but yeah.

513
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:55,020
The last person I
want to touch on

514
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,220
is a guy named
Satoshi Kamiya, who's

515
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:04,890
represented as probably
the foremost pioneer

516
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,630
of super-complex origami.

517
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:09,120
He is a little further
on the spectrum

518
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,310
on the traditional
style than many

519
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:16,590
of these other
super-complex folders,

520
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:21,490
characterized by kind of
very exact, straight creases,

521
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:28,170
this texturing for example, a
unique balance between making

522
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:34,540
a very cleanly folded--
The Japanese traditionally

523
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:39,580
make very clean subjects in
terms of exactness and form.

524
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,300
Here's a little more
shaping in the wet-folding.

525
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,960
But again, this is one
of my favorite works

526
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,200
of his, another Lord
of the Rings character.

527
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,360

528
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,410
What's neat about this
sea turtle actually,

529
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:58,810
the diagrams for it
were just published.

530
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:04,450
I first all this work in
2001 or something like that.

531
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:08,580
But it has these plates
on the back, this texture,

532
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,610
but it also has plates on
the front of the model.

533
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,470
So you can actually
pick it up, and it

534
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:17,720
looks very, very convincing.

535
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,780
Here are some more
models by him.

536
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,700
Again, you can see a lot
of this texturing here

537
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:27,800
in this wasp, very
clean folding.

538
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:32,430
A dog, multi-headed
dog, a caribou

539
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:36,820
with very complicated antler
patterns, and this dragon.

540
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:40,500
And again, you see the
crisp, clean folding,

541
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,300
but at the same time very
well-planned and well-designed

542
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,830
3D structure to be
shaped afterwards.

543
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,390
Here's another work that
I particularly enjoy.

544
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:53,460

545
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:59,930
Really lending this texturing
he applies throughout the model,

546
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:04,230
and it's a very
cohesive subject,

547
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,370
from an artistic sense.

548
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,300
It's very complete.

549
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,340
There's the same level
of detail everywhere

550
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,360
on the model, which
is very useful.

551
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,800
And I'm going to kind of
end this artistic side

552
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,670
with a model which
is widely regarded

553
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:24,370
as the most complex
single work in origami.

554
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:29,080
This took Kamiya over the
course of a year to fold.

555
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,510
There's thousands of
scales on this guy.

556
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,760
And again, it's one square
sheet of paper without cutting.

557
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:39,201
You see that it's
a very long model.

558
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:40,659
You'd think that
this subject would

559
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:43,639
be much better represented
by a long rectangle

560
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,050
or something like that.

561
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,250
But actually it's
very symmetric.

562
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:53,389
This crease pattern,
which we'll look at later,

563
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:56,300
actually has an
asymmetric crease pattern

564
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,520
and is quite ingenious
in how he decides

565
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,320
to accomplish this
form and structure.

566
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,720
If you're interested in learning
more about the origami art

567
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,660
side of things, there's this
phenomenal document documentary

568
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,850
which you can and
purchase online.

569
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:20,520
Or I've believe OrigaMIT
has a copy of this,

570
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,820
and we'll probably be
screening it some time

571
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,430
this semester or next.

572
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,600
It's called Between the Folds.

573
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:35,660
And it features, among others,
both Erik and Marty Demaine,

574
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,020
Robert Lang, and many more.

575
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:42,360
And there's a picture
of Stata from the film.

576
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,205
Now we're going to move on a
little bit to origami design.

577
00:35:46,205 --> 00:35:50,460

578
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,640
We've learned what
the algorithms are

579
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,530
behind a lot of origami
design, but now we're

580
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:02,160
going to see how that applies
more directly to creating

581
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,710
a representational work of art.

582
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:06,220
If you're really
serious about wanting

583
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:10,840
to get into origami design, this
book, Origami Design Secrets

584
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,540
by Robert Lang, is really
the first major book

585
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,870
on the methods of
origami design.

586
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:21,060
Most origami books are
traditionally about diagrams,

587
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,050
trying to fold specific models.

588
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,380
This is the first
book really to lay out

589
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,140
some of the ground rules
of how you create models.

590
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:32,070
And it goes through a number of
the things we've talked about.

591
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:37,550
So just to review a little bit
about tree theory, the idea,

592
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:42,650
the process is you start with
a subject, like this picture

593
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:47,480
I took at a Japanese
museum of a little crab.

594
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,270
You kind of draw a
little stick figure

595
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:55,110
of what that crab might look
like in a one-dimensional form,

596
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,050
characterized just
by the lengths

597
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:00,000
of these flaps and
the connectedness.

598
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,880
You go from here to here
to an origami base, which

599
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,880
has all of those flaps
of the right length

600
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,377
and connected in the right way.

601
00:37:09,377 --> 00:37:11,210
And then you shape it
into an origami model.

602
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:18,610
Now this method, this step here
might seem hard to you guys.

603
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:26,420
With a little experience,
it's actually very reasonable

604
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:30,030
to assume that someone
fairly well versed

605
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,520
in the vocabulary
of origami will

606
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,070
be able to accomplish that step.

607
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:38,220
This step, again, this kind
of child's play, somewhat.

608
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,350
It's actually not,
to do it really well,

609
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,100
to represent this model
as a stick figure,

610
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:49,730
and we'll see that when we
try to go through an example.

611
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,450
This step is the one where
algorithms and mathematics

612
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:56,530
really help to do a
lot of the work for us,

613
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:02,050
and essentially is kind of the
easy part from our perspective,

614
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:05,180
because it's kind of
methodical and there's

615
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,860
algorithms involved
to help us out.

616
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:10,750

617
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:16,090
The most artistic
and free things

618
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,040
we can do with
origami design are

619
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,820
kind of this step in the
shaping and this step

620
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,700
in defining the proportions.

621
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:29,490
In this step really you define
what the abstraction you

622
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,430
choose to characterize
in your model.

623
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:35,950
Like here, we are
choosing to represent

624
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:38,090
all four legs on either side.

625
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,900
You don't have too.

626
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:48,260
But we also decided to model
the eyes and the claws as is.

627
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:52,130
But an underbelly to a crab.

628
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,320
We could have modeled
that with the texture.

629
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,720
We could have modeled the
little mouth parts of the crab.

630
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,430
There are many things we
could choose to model on here

631
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:06,090
that we don't choose to.

632
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:08,320
So this is one level
of abstraction.

633
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,230

634
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,650
And this comes with
a lot of choice.

635
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:17,540
Here, there's lots of algorithms
and math to help us out.

636
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,380
But as we'll see,
there is actually

637
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,700
a lot of choice going
from here to here

638
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,970
as well, artistic choice,
and from here to here, again,

639
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:34,800
probably the most blatant
way that an artist can

640
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,240
put his style in essence
into an origami work.

641
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,670

642
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,087
AUDIENCE: What is
the extra fringe?

643
00:39:45,087 --> 00:39:45,920
JASON KU: Which one?

644
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,480
This?

645
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,810
AUDIENCE: Diagonal from the top.

646
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:49,904
AUDIENCE: On the left.

647
00:39:49,904 --> 00:39:50,820
JASON KU: On the left.

648
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,931
Oh, this?

649
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:52,430
OK.

650
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:58,760
So I modeled here
the body of this crab

651
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,400
as a flap coming from here.

652
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,870
I kind of wanted a flap
to cover the rest of this.

653
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:08,760
And so that's why I've added
this leg of the tree there.

654
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,200

655
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:19,120
While branch edges-- this
is a branch edge, it doesn't

656
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:24,630
terminate-- will provide
paper in that region,

657
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:28,690
as we'll see later,
branch edges of the tree,

658
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:32,560
rivers in the space
allocation, really

659
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,470
don't lend themselves to
being shaped very easily.

660
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:39,900
And so if I isolate
that body segment

661
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,510
as a leaf edge
for itself, then I

662
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:47,200
can actually control
a little more

663
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,020
about how I'm able to shape it.

664
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,390
Good question.

665
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,290
So we're going to
review a little bit

666
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:55,040
about uniaxial bases.

667
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:01,020
This these are the definitions
that Erik Demaine posed

668
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:06,580
in the algorithm, I
think in lecture four.

669
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,250
Again, you have
this uniaxial base.

670
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:15,680
It has these
characteristics that it's

671
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:22,730
in the positive space above
the z equals zero plane.

672
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,170
And that's kind of
represented here.

673
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:32,800
The intersection with that
plane is the projection.

674
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,710
So if you shine
the light above it,

675
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:39,530
it would cast a shadow of
a stick figure out, which

676
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,110
is exactly kind of what we want.

677
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:45,340
We want to make an origami
base that associates itself

678
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,500
with a stick figure.

679
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:51,420
And then we partition
the faces into flaps.

680
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,795
So there's all
these definitions.

681
00:41:52,795 --> 00:41:56,840

682
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,320
I think to put these in
kind of layman's terms

683
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,790
from an origami designer's
point of view, what

684
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:07,380
do these really mean?

685
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,760
Really, the important
characteristics that we want

686
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:15,450
are that the flaps lie along
or straddle a single line.

687
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,980
Because if they do that, then
we could just fold it in half

688
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,010
and it will have that
property of everything

689
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:27,190
being above an axis and
everything lying along an axis,

690
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:31,120
and that the flaps hinge
perpendicular to that axis.

691
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,660
The reason why we need the
flaps to hinge perpendicular

692
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,790
to the axis is if they don't
hinge perpendicular to the axis

693
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:48,040
then you will not be able
to create a projection

694
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,410
to the plane that is a
one-dimensional stick figure.

695
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:54,380
If these hinges are
tilted then that line

696
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,040
will project to a line instead
of a point, like we'd want.

697
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:02,290
We'd want it to project to
a single node on the tree.

698
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:06,000
In any of these
uniaxial bases, think

699
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,710
about the base being thinned
in the limiting case, that we

700
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:17,650
can create folds parallel to
this axis and thin this model

701
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:20,330
until it's right along the axis.

702
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,860
And then in that
limiting case it

703
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,300
is a stick figure, essentially.

704
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:29,920
And once it is a stick figure,
layering and orientation

705
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,610
of the flaps really
don't matter,

706
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:35,960
because it is the stick figure.

707
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,170
So this is kind of an
informal definition,

708
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:43,330
but we'll use these
later in the lecture.

709
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,680
So what is a flap?

710
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:51,710
We kind of made this argument
a couple lectures ago.

711
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:54,920

712
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,050
So we want to model a flap, so
that we can kind of stick it

713
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:58,727
together.

714
00:43:58,727 --> 00:44:00,310
And this is kind of
an intuitive sense

715
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:04,900
of we take a sheet of paper,
we thin it a little bit,

716
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:10,010
we hinge it perpendicular
to some axis.

717
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:13,620
And when we do and
we unfold the paper,

718
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,620
we see that it
takes up this kind

719
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,475
of quarter octagon of paper.

720
00:44:17,475 --> 00:44:21,500

721
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:28,200
Now, if we continue
to thin this,

722
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,180
if we make it
really, really thin,

723
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:34,660
you see how deep the boundary,
this fold that we make,

724
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:39,460
will little closer and
closer approximate a circle.

725
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,100
Everyone see that?

726
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,800
It's kind of like an umbrella.

727
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,450
I like this analogy
with an umbrella.

728
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:46,835
That you have a
single point that's

729
00:44:46,835 --> 00:44:48,210
the center the
umbrella, and when

730
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:53,480
you close the umbrella,
all of the umbrella

731
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,680
kind of maps to a single line.

732
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:03,950
And so it's neat to
see on the paper.

733
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:05,840
It's kind of what
you could think

734
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,650
of as a projection to this tree.

735
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:17,190
Lines on the unfolded
square, these lines

736
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:20,300
at the edges of the circle,
map to a single point

737
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:27,900
on this flap, or infinitely thin
flap, or essentially the tree.

738
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:35,650
This is kind of a
leaf edge of our tree.

739
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:40,670
And so everything along this
line maps to a single point,

740
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:42,330
is compressed onto
a single point.

741
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:47,780
You can do that with any
point going up this flap.

742
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:51,120
We can actually pick
off a point here,

743
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:57,340
and we see a line of constant
elevation with respect

744
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,510
to this flap.

745
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:05,040
And so now we've created
a very, very simple tree.

746
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:11,210
Instead of one leaf
edge extending off

747
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:15,900
of the rest of the model, we
have a branch edge, and then

748
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,380
a leaf edge.

749
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:25,230
And this branch edge is
corresponding to this strip

750
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:27,160
of paper here of constant width.

751
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,160
That's what we call a river.

752
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:33,040
And we see that a circle is
just a limiting case of a river.

753
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,740
Rivers separates two parts of
the model off from each other

754
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,980
by a constant distance.

755
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:42,060
That's what that constant
thickness strip of paper means.

756
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:45,250
And the circle is really
just a limiting case

757
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:52,125
off that river that separates
only a single point away

758
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:53,250
from the rest of the model.

759
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:57,620

760
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,120
That's all I want
to say about that.

761
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:07,290
And we can actually
tile these rivers

762
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,860
onto a plane to create
arbitrary trees.

763
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:13,476
So here's an example
of the correspondence.

764
00:47:13,476 --> 00:47:16,050

765
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:20,380
I call these
circle/river packings.

766
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,480
That's the common term
in origami design.

767
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,860
This is a circle/river packing.

768
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:28,460
It's kind of a space allocation.

769
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:31,420
It's an idealization.

770
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,110
The model we make
is actually not

771
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:35,590
going to be infinitely thin.

772
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:41,602
So each flap is going to take up
more space than these circles.

773
00:47:41,602 --> 00:47:42,810
But it's a good idealization.

774
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:46,850

775
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:50,980
This circle/river packing
or this space allocation

776
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,640
actually maps
uniquely to as a tree.

777
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:58,690
So if we go through
it, this point,

778
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:04,550
this circle here might map
to this line on the tree.

779
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:09,340
It can actually also map to this
line, this edge or this edge,

780
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:11,360
as well.

781
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:15,755
Because I don't really care
how these flaps are oriented.

782
00:48:15,755 --> 00:48:18,340

783
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:20,840
The tree is just
supposed to preserve

784
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,230
length and connectedness.

785
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:25,500
It doesn't really have to do
with where they're mapped.

786
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,840
And so we'll see some
examples of that later.

787
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:34,920
But we can kind of
go through this tree

788
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:40,400
and see all the
different aspects of it,

789
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,940
how the edges correspond
to circles and rivers

790
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,220
on the packing.

791
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,390
And we're going to do a
little bit of practice

792
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:53,950
for that, because I think
that was one of the day

793
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:56,890
hardest parts for me starting
out in origami design,

794
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:01,100
was being able to be comfortable
with going from a tree

795
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,950
to a space allocation, from
a space allocation to a tree.

796
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:08,990
Getting that concept in my
head was kind of difficult.

797
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:11,820
So how about we
practice a little bit.

798
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:16,450
We have this space allocation
of maybe two circles, a river,

799
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:20,390
and three more circles.

800
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:26,050
I'll just give you a second to
see which one of these trees

801
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:31,690
is represented by
this space allocation.

802
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:35,600
Or should I say
how many of these.

803
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,670
Because some of these
trees might be equivalent.

804
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:43,920
So we're going to start with
the upper right one here.

805
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,590

806
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:52,110
Does it correspond to
this space allocation?

807
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:52,740
Yes or no?

808
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,470
No.

809
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:54,724
Why?

810
00:49:54,724 --> 00:49:55,656
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

811
00:49:55,656 --> 00:49:56,280
JASON KU: Yeah.

812
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,820
So the topology's kind of wrong.

813
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,750
You've got three equal
length flaps up here,

814
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:01,820
which is what we want.

815
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:04,920
We want three equal
length flaps separated off

816
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,930
from the rest of the model by
a river of the same length.

817
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:11,060
That makes sense.

818
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:16,360
But instead of separating
off two flaps, two leaf

819
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,430
edges of maybe
twice the length, it

820
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:24,010
separates three of the same
length, which doesn't quite

821
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:24,540
work out.

822
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,200
So the distances and
the connectivity's

823
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,330
kind of off here, just
terms of the numbers.

824
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:31,815
So this one's wrong.

825
00:50:31,815 --> 00:50:34,360
How about this one?

826
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:34,860
Yes.

827
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:35,440
Right?

828
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,500
It has the right topology.

829
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,310
This one?

830
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:42,100
No, again.

831
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,160
The wrong typology.

832
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:50,010
There is, again, three separated
from two by a branch edge.

833
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:54,600
But it doesn't have
the right lengths

834
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,300
associated with this
space allocation.

835
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,210
And how about this one?

836
00:50:58,210 --> 00:50:58,710
Yes.

837
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:00,530
Right?

838
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:04,730
I've transformed this
tree from here to here.

839
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:09,200
I just moved them around
with respect to each other.

840
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,700
They're equivalent, in terms
of how we choose our tree.

841
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,690
And this will be important
when we actually use TreeMaker.

842
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:20,830

843
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:25,720
Because it doesn't matter how
we orient things in our tree,

844
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:31,070
we can manipulate where we
put our circles on the paper

845
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:32,650
to get the same tree.

846
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:36,140
The mapping from here
to a tree is unique.

847
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,520
Mapping from a tree
to a space allocation

848
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,895
is not, which leads to
interesting design choices

849
00:51:42,895 --> 00:51:47,280
that you can make in
designing an origami model.

850
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,940
Yeah, those two.

851
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,130
One more time.

852
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:53,630
We'll go through this
one a little quicker.

853
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:56,960
I'll give you maybe
five seconds or so.

854
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,340

855
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:04,050
So we're going to start with
this one, the first one.

856
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:07,880
Does that map to this
space allocation?

857
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

858
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:11,540
JASON KU: Yes, it does.

859
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:18,550
We have two equal length set off
from the same length to equal,

860
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:20,080
and then one twice as big.

861
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:26,280
And see how I've actually
added a redundant node here.

862
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:31,720
I've split this leaf edge into
a branch edge and a leaf edge.

863
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,870
That's kind of a redundant
node that I don't really need.

864
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:37,710
It doesn't really change
the topology of this at all.

865
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:41,750
It would just map to
a line right here.

866
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:42,860
Everyone see that?

867
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,830
How about this one?

868
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:45,330
No.

869
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:46,080
Right?

870
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,970
For a number of reasons
that I won't go into.

871
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:51,410
How about this one?

872
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:51,910
No.

873
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:55,930
Again, the distances and
the topology are wrong.

874
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:57,470
This one?

875
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:59,000
No.

876
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,610
This is actually one of the
trees from the slide before.

877
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:04,030
And this one?

878
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:05,160
Yes.

879
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:08,370
This is actually just a
manipulation of that tree.

880
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:09,670
So yay!

881
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:11,290
We're awesome.

882
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:14,170
Now, going the other way
is not necessarily unique.

883
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:17,090

884
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:19,500
So there would be
multiple answers here.

885
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,730

886
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:29,170
Is this a correct
representation of this tree?

887
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,144
Yes or no?

888
00:53:31,144 --> 00:53:31,940
AUDIENCE: No.

889
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,815
JASON KU: It has the
correct topology, right?

890
00:53:33,815 --> 00:53:37,080
It has three equal length
flaps separated off by a river

891
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,340
from three equal length flaps.

892
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,381
That's what we have here.

893
00:53:39,381 --> 00:53:44,500
But this river is actually twice
as long as any of these flaps.

894
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:47,310
So this is actually
a little bit shorter

895
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:49,800
than the length of
any of these flaps,

896
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,650
not really working for us there.

897
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:54,920
How about this one?

898
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,960
No, for pretty much
the same reason.

899
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,760
It actually has a very
similar, if not identical, tree

900
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,330
to this one.

901
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:05,270
How about this one?

902
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:08,730
No, topological problems there.

903
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:10,280
This one?

904
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,040
Yes.

905
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,240
So it's got three equal
length flaps separated off

906
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,350
by a large 2x river, I guess.

907
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:18,960
And this one?

908
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,550

909
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,710
No, for the same reason here.

910
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:27,580
And here we can actually
see three different packings

911
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:34,520
of a very similar,
if not same, tree.

912
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,270
And this goes to
show you that there

913
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:39,380
could be many
different ways we could

914
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:43,270
put these disks on a sheet of
paper that could either improve

915
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:45,990
efficiency or be more useful.

916
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:50,450
For example, this packing
has a central flap.

917
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:53,320
We may or may not want
that central flap.

918
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:57,800
You can see that a central
flap will use more paper

919
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:02,520
than a flap at the corner
or the edge of the paper,

920
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:06,560
because it has 360
degrees of paper

921
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:09,420
that you have to fold
as opposed to 180

922
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:13,930
or even just 90
degrees of paper.

923
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:15,930
So typically in
origami design, if you

924
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:19,610
have a flap you need a little
bit of bulk in, a little more

925
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:21,510
paper, you might
want to consider

926
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:23,460
making that a central flap.

927
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:27,390
If you want to make a very thin,
maybe an antenna or something,

928
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:30,010
a corner flap might
be a better choice.

929
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:32,660

930
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:35,180
So correct, in that sense.

931
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:38,390
Now again, I want
to stress the fact

932
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:40,130
that this is an idealization.

933
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:41,360
These are circles.

934
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:48,576
They don't really account for
all the paper in the square.

935
00:55:48,576 --> 00:55:51,460
This paper between the
circles and the rivers

936
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,260
is not really used.

937
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:58,530
Pretty much everything in
this no man's land here

938
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:04,440
actually maps to a single
point in the tree right.

939
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:08,710
This is a bad example, so
I'll use this correspondence.

940
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:11,440
This kind of looks like a
bikini or something like that.

941
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,460
That's neither here nor there.

942
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:20,790
But this space all maps to
one of these branch nodes.

943
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:22,140
Everyone see that?

944
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:29,180
Because in the situation where
we thin this model infinitely,

945
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,730
this is kind of extra
space that we kind of just

946
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:33,590
don't even deal with.

947
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:36,520
In reality, that
extra space will

948
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:40,950
have to go into either
the rivers or the circles

949
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:42,060
in the packing.

950
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:47,730
So the reason why uniaxial
bases are nice in this model

951
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:54,220
is because since all they hinge
creases of the model, basically

952
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,760
the boundary of the
flap with the model,

953
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:08,030
hinge 90 degrees to some
axis, then its projection maps

954
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:09,280
to a single point.

955
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,340
So if we cut off all the
flaps along the hinge creases,

956
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:17,195
we should actually get
a very similar mapping

957
00:57:17,195 --> 00:57:18,070
to what we have here.

958
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:23,870
And here's an example of
a fairly complex model.

959
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:27,290
But you can see, I've
just highlighted the locus

960
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:30,870
of possible hinge
creases on this model.

961
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:32,820
There's a unique way to do this.

962
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:33,910
I won't go into it.

963
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:38,280
But there is a unique way
to add these hinge creases.

964
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:42,530
But as you can see, the
idea is very similar.

965
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:46,360
But instead of having these
curves of constant width,

966
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:50,050
you have these discrete angular
curves of constant width.

967
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:54,830
So for example here, you have
a river of constant width

968
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:58,580
that changes directions
at a discrete corner,

969
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:01,210
but it's still a strip
of constant width.

970
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:02,750
Everyone see that?

971
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:06,739
So maybe we could
go ahead and see--

972
00:58:06,739 --> 00:58:08,530
If we had this crease
pattern and we didn't

973
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:10,730
know what the model
was, we could actually

974
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:14,930
pick off the tree and figure
out what this model is.

975
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:21,160
So maybe we start with
these two points down here.

976
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,470
They're all points separated
off the rest of the model

977
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:25,100
by a certain distance.

978
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:33,130
And that distance here, all
these lines that are connected

979
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:37,350
must be at the same location,
the same node on the tree,

980
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:40,610
because all those hinge creases
must map to a single point.

981
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:45,820
So these two flaps
connect with each other

982
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:49,310
because they share this
set of hinge creases.

983
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:51,500
And so that's that
point right there.

984
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:56,790
I'm going to ignore these two
flaps at the bottom for now.

985
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:59,480
We have this big long river.

986
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:02,640
I'm just going to deal
with the big points first.

987
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,190
And that connects to
two more big points.

988
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:07,760

989
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,850
Everyone see that?

990
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:10,580
I don't want to go too fast.

991
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:13,290
And actually, you can do that.

992
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:16,760
You can just keep doing that,
and methodically picking off

993
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,620
distances on this hinge
crease representation,

994
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:23,730
this is discrete
space allocation

995
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:26,365
and fill in the whole tree.

996
00:59:26,365 --> 00:59:29,090

997
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:33,460
Anyone can think of
what this might be?

998
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:39,410
Maybe a four-legged animal with
antlers, like maybe a moose.

999
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:42,520
So this is a model
I designed, I think,

1000
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:45,232
my freshman year
as an undergrad.

1001
00:59:45,232 --> 00:59:46,732
AUDIENCE: What
happens when you have

1002
00:59:46,732 --> 00:59:48,430
the squares inside the squares?

1003
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:56,045

1004
00:59:56,045 --> 00:59:57,670
JASON KU: That's an
excellent question.

1005
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:59,820
First, I want to answer
one other question

1006
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:01,160
before I get to that one.

1007
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:10,110
Here, these polygons,
these squares,

1008
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:13,980
you could think of maybe
putting a circle in them.

1009
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:18,940
And the square is taking up
more paper than the circle,

1010
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:21,990
and so the flap
that this represents

1011
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:25,700
would be the largest circle
that would be fully contained

1012
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,380
in that square.

1013
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,180
And that would be the
length of that flap.

1014
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:32,610
What does it mean to have
instead of this point separated

1015
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:35,500
off from the rest of the model
have a line separated off

1016
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,170
from the rest of the model?

1017
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:43,940
Can anyone guess
why would you want

1018
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:47,210
that as an origami designer?

1019
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,230
Well, you might
want that property

1020
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:53,710
if you want not just
a point separated

1021
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:55,570
off from the rest of
the model, but a line.

1022
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:57,300
You might want thickness.

1023
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,910
It's a qualification
of thickness

1024
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:04,980
of that flap at the extreme
distance away from the model.

1025
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:07,890

1026
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:11,010
And I don't have
this example with me.

1027
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:14,160
I talked about it yesterday
at the OrigaMIT lecture.

1028
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:17,860
But let's say you wanted
to model a butterfly wing.

1029
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:22,920
It's not well
characterized by a stick.

1030
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,930
Its thickness is
kind of important.

1031
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:29,030
So how I designed
a butterfly wing

1032
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:31,730
is I separated a line
off from the rest

1033
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:36,400
of the model, something
similar to this,

1034
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,100
so that I would have enough
paper to kind of spread out

1035
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:42,240
that idealized single point.

1036
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:47,380
I could spread the end of that
point to have some thickness

1037
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:51,490
and to make a full
butterfly wing.

1038
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:53,580
And what you're
saying is what does it

1039
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:57,670
mean to have these points,
these single leaf edges,

1040
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:00,220
separated off kind of
surrounded by river?

1041
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,830

1042
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:03,960
You see what that means?

1043
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,740
Yep, this is just a river.

1044
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:10,010
Rivers, again, don't have to
go all the way across a model.

1045
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:11,680
They can also connect.

1046
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,360
You're separating
these two points off

1047
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:18,130
from the rest of the model by
a certain constant distance.

1048
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:19,470
So excellent question.

1049
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:24,530

1050
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:30,080
And as I promised before, I
want to take look a little bit

1051
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:33,880
about the structure
of this model.

1052
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,350
It looks very symmetric, right?

1053
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:39,460
And you'd think that maybe
it would be well represented

1054
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:43,090
by a rectangle of paper
instead of a square.

1055
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:45,510
How do you fit
this into a square

1056
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:46,835
by still having this detail?

1057
01:02:46,835 --> 01:02:50,430

1058
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:52,430
How do you think this
texture was made?

1059
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:55,490

1060
01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:55,990
Anybody?

1061
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:59,560

1062
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:03,924
It's kind of just pleating
the paper back and forth.

1063
01:03:03,924 --> 01:03:06,740
If you've ever taken
a sheet of paper

1064
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:10,580
and pleated it to
form a texture,

1065
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:12,050
kind of a
one-dimensional problem,

1066
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:13,630
but you're pleating it.

1067
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:15,305
But after you pleat
it, it's smaller.

1068
01:03:15,305 --> 01:03:19,750

1069
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:22,456
If we take a look at the
crease pattern here--

1070
01:03:22,456 --> 01:03:23,830
This is actually
a crease pattern

1071
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:28,410
to an earlier version
of this model.

1072
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:30,500
This is slightly
less detailed, if you

1073
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:34,360
can imagine, than
this model right here.

1074
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:38,120

1075
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,270
What do you think this is?

1076
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:43,060
Maybe the scales, right?

1077
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:45,570
This is the head region.

1078
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:50,040
We can actually do
a rough version,

1079
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,870
perform a rough version of
this kind of hinge crease

1080
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:56,000
representation, and get
an idea for the structure

1081
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,770
of this model.

1082
01:03:57,770 --> 01:04:02,210
So here, we see the tail.

1083
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:03,530
I'll talk about this later.

1084
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:06,472
We have the two back
feet separated off

1085
01:04:06,472 --> 01:04:08,180
from the rest of the
model by a distance.

1086
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:10,540
That's this distance here.

1087
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:13,070
Two more feet.

1088
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:15,600
This is kind of the neck region.

1089
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,900
And here's the head.

1090
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:18,400
OK.

1091
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,080
So this looks kind of weird.

1092
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:24,170
I haven't really been specific
about the details here.

1093
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:26,530
But what does that pleating do?

1094
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:29,730
Well, it shrinks the
useful area of the paper,

1095
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:31,200
because I pleated it.

1096
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,980
So that's why here the
length of this flap

1097
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:36,160
is this distance here.

1098
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,480
That's the length of the tail.

1099
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:40,290

1100
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:43,760
But when I make pleats,
this thing shrinks.

1101
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,670
And it actually shrinks
to this distance.

1102
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:51,840
This whole thing is cut in half.

1103
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:55,580
So we make these
pleats, it shrinks,

1104
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:59,330
and then it can lie
along this segment.

1105
01:04:59,330 --> 01:05:06,680
Then this area here
also shrinks by half.

1106
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,520
So the length is here.

1107
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:13,770
And it is able to cover
this aspect, this part

1108
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:17,110
of this middle
river with texture.

1109
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:21,084

1110
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,000
Please ask questions,
because this is complex.

1111
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,208
AUDIENCE: [? What's the ?]
distance between the front

1112
01:05:25,208 --> 01:05:25,947
and back legs?

1113
01:05:25,947 --> 01:05:26,530
JASON KU: Yes.

1114
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:29,209
So this is the distance between
the front and back legs.

1115
01:05:29,209 --> 01:05:30,750
But we have to cover
it with texture.

1116
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,310
There's no texture here.

1117
01:05:32,310 --> 01:05:36,480
So what we do is create
this extra flap here

1118
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:43,940
where the back legs are with
a length of half of this,

1119
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,340
and cover it with texture.

1120
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:48,350
So that's what he's done here.

1121
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:52,260
And so the same goes for here.

1122
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:56,650
It's not quite half down
here, but this covers up

1123
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:58,376
the rest of that section.

1124
01:05:58,376 --> 01:05:59,750
And there's actually
some overlap

1125
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:02,110
so that they can mesh correctly.

1126
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:06,520
Then here, we have enough paper
to provide texture to the neck

1127
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,260
region, and then
there's the head.

1128
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:12,380
It's kind of an ingenious way
of actually the top and bottom,

1129
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:15,280
this top texture and
this bottom texture,

1130
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:19,260
folding up onto this line
segment which represents

1131
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:23,600
the length of the
dragon, and still

1132
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:28,250
having space for
these toes and feet.

1133
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:33,350
It's an ingenious way
to distribute the paper,

1134
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:34,430
in this case.

1135
01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:36,590
Here we can understand
another reason

1136
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:39,440
why we might want to
separate a line off

1137
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,070
from the rest of the model,
because then that line has

1138
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:45,250
some thickness, you have
a certain amount of space

1139
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:47,230
out there, and you
can actually then

1140
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:51,010
create more points
from that line being

1141
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:53,020
out at a certain distance.

1142
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:56,720
We can create a number of little
points, which are then toes.

1143
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:00,310

1144
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:04,100
So I thought that
was pretty cool.

1145
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,800
One of my favorite
examples of structure.

1146
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:07,770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1147
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:11,170

1148
01:07:11,170 --> 01:07:12,950
JASON KU: These were
all drawn by hand

1149
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:15,835
using a program very similar
to Adobe Illustrator.

1150
01:07:15,835 --> 01:07:18,380

1151
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:21,990
So yeah, it's very tedious, and
lots of copying and pasting.

1152
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:26,390
But you should see the
more complicated version

1153
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:28,570
of this pattern.

1154
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:32,790
Because as you can see
on this model here,

1155
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:38,220
there are actually scales
on the feet part itself.

1156
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:45,490
These claws actually are longer
in proportion to everything

1157
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:46,950
else in the model.

1158
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:48,690
So we actually add
some more things.

1159
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:51,880
There's also a
strip of paper here

1160
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,230
that has spines on the back.

1161
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:57,290
This crease pattern doesn't
represent those things.

1162
01:07:57,290 --> 01:08:00,869
So this is a simplified
version, if you will.

1163
01:08:00,869 --> 01:08:02,952
AUDIENCE: What was the
starting size of the paper?

1164
01:08:02,952 --> 01:08:06,290
AUDIENCE: Yeah, how big is it?

1165
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:08,530
JASON KU: It's actually
an amazingly efficient use

1166
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:10,270
of paper.

1167
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:13,100
The length of the
dragon is pretty much

1168
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:16,710
this length right
here, which is actually

1169
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:19,150
quite impressive for the
amount of detail there is.

1170
01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:22,319

1171
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:23,790
The shrinkage
factor is something

1172
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:26,010
like to the length
of the squared

1173
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:28,954
to the length of the
dragon is not even a half.

1174
01:08:28,954 --> 01:08:33,410

1175
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:36,490
The overall structure of this
model is actually quite simple.

1176
01:08:36,490 --> 01:08:40,729

1177
01:08:40,729 --> 01:08:44,920
The model itself is
maybe about this big.

1178
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,609
So I'm guessing the
size of the square

1179
01:08:47,609 --> 01:08:50,729
was something like a meter,
if not a little larger.

1180
01:08:50,729 --> 01:08:54,899

1181
01:08:54,899 --> 01:08:57,720
It's a long time to work
with a single sheet of paper.

1182
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:58,220
All right.

1183
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:01,740
So we're going to very quickly,
maybe for the next 10, 15

1184
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:05,770
minutes, go through a
design example of a crab.

1185
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:10,490
And so we're going to kind
of go through it quickly.

1186
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:12,520
To help you do your
homework, I just

1187
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:16,870
want to let you know about
some details of TreeMaker that

1188
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:19,220
might be useful to
you to be able to make

1189
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:21,880
a cleaner or nicer
crease pattern.

1190
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:27,819
So to go to a TreeMaker example,
I'm going to open up TreeMaker.

1191
01:09:27,819 --> 01:09:34,410

1192
01:09:34,410 --> 01:09:40,164
I need to bring
TreeMaker over here.

1193
01:09:40,164 --> 01:09:42,950

1194
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:44,290
So we have TreeMaker.

1195
01:09:44,290 --> 01:09:47,469

1196
01:09:47,469 --> 01:09:49,010
And let's say we
want to make a crab.

1197
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:52,479
So how do you want
to draw this tree?

1198
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,520
Maybe I'll just draw the
tree that we had before.

1199
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:57,420

1200
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:06,370
First we have four legs
all of equal length.

1201
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:10,300

1202
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:13,730
We could have them all
coming from the same spot.

1203
01:10:13,730 --> 01:10:37,170
But traditionally, if we
take a look at a crab--

1204
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:41,340
That's a cartoony
version of a crab,

1205
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:47,080
but we see that these maybe
our axis of our model is here.

1206
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:53,070
These legs actually don't
need to split at the axis.

1207
01:10:53,070 --> 01:10:57,330
We could actually model
this as in the tree,

1208
01:10:57,330 --> 01:11:02,650
maybe we have our body
segment, and maybe we

1209
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:07,760
separate these four
flaps off from the axis

1210
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,620
by a certain distance so that
we actually can save paper.

1211
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:14,310
We don't have to make each
one of these flaps this long.

1212
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:15,550
You see?

1213
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:18,920
So I'm going to add a
little line segment there.

1214
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:25,010
Repeat on the other side.

1215
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:25,765
You get the idea.

1216
01:11:25,765 --> 01:11:28,530

1217
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:31,550
Then maybe you
have some modeling

1218
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:34,270
of the thickness of the model.

1219
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:36,140
Then we have claws.

1220
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:40,200

1221
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:44,300
One nice thing about this is
we could view just the tree.

1222
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,190
That might make things
a little easier.

1223
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:47,940
There's lots of these
view characteristics

1224
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:49,680
that we're going to
take advantage of.

1225
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:53,070

1226
01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:57,040
And maybe we want to
represent the eyes.

1227
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,580

1228
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:05,140
Now, the lengths of these
edges in the program

1229
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:08,170
don't really mean anything.

1230
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:10,490
So take that into note first.

1231
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:12,950
You actually I've to
click on each edge

1232
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:16,260
and specify its length
relative to all the others.

1233
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:19,070
So maybe we want
to make the claws

1234
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:28,320
half as long as the
branch connecting them.

1235
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:33,550

1236
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:34,670
Bear with me.

1237
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:37,330

1238
01:12:37,330 --> 01:12:40,080
There's no good way of
automating this process

1239
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,400
at this point.

1240
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,010
And maybe we make
the eyes-- they're

1241
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:45,430
pretty short-- so
we maybe make them

1242
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:47,285
a quarter of the
length of those.

1243
01:12:47,285 --> 01:12:51,240

1244
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:55,500
The body segment, I don't know.

1245
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,650
Also a quarter.

1246
01:12:57,650 --> 01:12:59,310
This is really
kind of arbitrary,

1247
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:02,820
but you can play around
with these dimensions.

1248
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:06,140
And these guys, also a quarter.

1249
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:10,730
And the back legs
can also be one.

1250
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:12,130
Something like that.

1251
01:13:12,130 --> 01:13:13,160
All right.

1252
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:20,910
When we've got that, we see that
we actually have circles there.

1253
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:22,760
Now, these circles
are kind of crossing.

1254
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:26,530
We don't want
that, because paper

1255
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:28,930
can't go to two points at once.

1256
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:30,760
What we can do now
is scale everything.

1257
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:33,530

1258
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:37,910
So it tries to pack
all the circles such

1259
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:42,750
that none of the conditions
are being violated.

1260
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:47,710
So this is a valid packing,
except these points

1261
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:52,080
in the middle here, this
whole polygon is constrained.

1262
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:55,250
The green line segments
here are active paths.

1263
01:13:55,250 --> 01:14:01,750
Basically, the distance between
these points on the tree

1264
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:03,940
and these points on the
paper are minimized,

1265
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,640
or they're equal.

1266
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:08,170
So there must be a crease there.

1267
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:13,000
That is a key statement
of uniaxial bases,

1268
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,810
is that there must be a
crease along active paths.

1269
01:14:15,810 --> 01:14:20,250
Now, these two points can
actually stand to get larger.

1270
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:26,200

1271
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,870
That's evident to the fact
that we can move these around

1272
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:30,680
and it's not violating
any conditions.

1273
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:33,270
Well, if I move it over here,
it's violating a condition.

1274
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:34,970
Whenever a condition
is violated then

1275
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:38,110
you have these red
lines that yell at you.

1276
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:42,480
But we can move this
around in this area

1277
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,200
without violating
any conditions.

1278
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,900
So it's not happy.

1279
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:50,610
It's not completely crystallized
or well-constrained,

1280
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:52,160
so it's going to
yell at us when we

1281
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:56,520
try to build the crease pattern.

1282
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:00,000
TreeMaker was not able
to construct all polygons

1283
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,730
because a polygon was either
non-convex or contained

1284
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:05,390
one or more nodes
in its interiors.

1285
01:15:05,390 --> 01:15:07,289
So these have nodes
in its interior,

1286
01:15:07,289 --> 01:15:08,955
so was not able to
fill in this polygon.

1287
01:15:08,955 --> 01:15:12,030

1288
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:14,250
What we can do about
that is we don't

1289
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:17,620
mind if these points
get a little bigger.

1290
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:19,500
Or we could add an extra point.

1291
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:23,330
So we never modeled
a body segment here.

1292
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:25,250
So maybe we just add
in a body segment.

1293
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:27,970

1294
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:29,730
So scale everything here.

1295
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:32,730

1296
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:33,930
We still have this problem.

1297
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:36,890
This guy is unconstrained.

1298
01:15:36,890 --> 01:15:40,230
So what I'm going to do is
make this guy a little bigger

1299
01:15:40,230 --> 01:15:42,520
by selecting the
node and the edge.

1300
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:45,480
You have to do both.

1301
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:48,040
I can go here and scale
just this selection.

1302
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:50,820
And it'll increase it by itself.

1303
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:54,530

1304
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:59,250
Actually, nicely, this is
somewhat of a symmetric crease

1305
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:01,270
pattern, which
didn't occur before.

1306
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:10,150

1307
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:12,730
So you see these lighter
edges of the tree

1308
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:14,800
are fully constrained edges.

1309
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,180
These darker ones are not
fully constrained edges.

1310
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:20,280
So this guy can actually
also increase a little bit.

1311
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:24,840
So I'm going to scale selection.

1312
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,690
Now everything should be good.

1313
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:28,760
I can build the crease pattern.

1314
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,550
Guh!

1315
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:34,480
It built it, so whatever.

1316
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,040
So this is a foldable
crease pattern

1317
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,780
that will form
what we want it to.

1318
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:44,260
We can also go to
this creases view,

1319
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:47,870
and it will show the
creases of the model.

1320
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:50,480
It was not able to find
valid mountain-valleys.

1321
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:56,230

1322
01:16:56,230 --> 01:16:57,410
Anyway.

1323
01:16:57,410 --> 01:16:59,810
So to make this
cleaner, you might

1324
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:02,710
want to deal with symmetry.

1325
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:08,590
So there's an ability to
select diagonal symmetry

1326
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:15,730
and either add conditions
to make a node fixed

1327
01:17:15,730 --> 01:17:19,110
to the symmetry line, so
add additional constraints

1328
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:21,150
to our system to
make it cleaner.

1329
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:23,480
We can fix them to
the symmetry line.

1330
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,750
We can fix it to the
corner or the paper edge,

1331
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:27,560
fix to any arbitrary position.

1332
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,310
Or we can select two
nodes and pair them

1333
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:33,260
about the symmetry line, which
is a very useful thing to do.

1334
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:44,382

1335
01:17:44,382 --> 01:17:46,090
I don't know if it
will yell at me again.

1336
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:49,350
Yeah, it didn't do anything.

1337
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:51,790
What I'm going to
do is go in here.

1338
01:17:51,790 --> 01:17:53,830
There's lots of things
you could do here.

1339
01:17:53,830 --> 01:17:59,490
We could perturb all
the nodes, so they

1340
01:17:59,490 --> 01:18:01,780
move if by a slight distance.

1341
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:04,350
And maybe if we try
scaling it again,

1342
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:05,755
it'll find a valid solution.

1343
01:18:05,755 --> 01:18:17,060

1344
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:22,940
This was unfortunate.

1345
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:24,990
Scale everything.

1346
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:31,600

1347
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,070
Kill the strain on this.

1348
01:18:33,070 --> 01:18:49,230

1349
01:18:49,230 --> 01:18:50,552
Yes?

1350
01:18:50,552 --> 01:18:51,510
AUDIENCE: I'm confused.

1351
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:53,510
Is it failing
because the problem

1352
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:57,050
is over-constrained
or under-constrained?

1353
01:18:57,050 --> 01:18:59,230
JASON KU: It's not
failing because of either.

1354
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:04,840
It's failing because
certain creases

1355
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,280
get very close together.

1356
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,880
Now it's failing
because it can't

1357
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:11,862
find a correct
valley-mountain assignment

1358
01:19:11,862 --> 01:19:12,820
for the crease pattern.

1359
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:16,540
So it's able to build
the creases fine.

1360
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:21,670
So build crease pattern, fine.

1361
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:24,620
It just wasn't able to construct
a mountain-valley assignment,

1362
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:26,690
which in the creases view
would usually give you

1363
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:28,023
mountain and valley assignments.

1364
01:19:28,023 --> 01:19:30,350
AUDIENCE: That means
it's not possible?

1365
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:31,642
JASON KU: It couldn't find it.

1366
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:32,975
It's not that it's not possible.

1367
01:19:32,975 --> 01:19:36,330
It just couldn't find it.

1368
01:19:36,330 --> 01:19:37,790
I want to say one other thing.

1369
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:43,360

1370
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,150
Kill the crease pattern.

1371
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:49,570
We have a polygon bounded
by active paths that's

1372
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:51,560
not triangular.

1373
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:58,182
But we can actually split it
any of these up into triangles.

1374
01:19:58,182 --> 01:20:00,140
I'm just going to mention
that you can do this.

1375
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:03,320
You click on one
of these polygons,

1376
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:06,850
go here, stub, triangulate tree.

1377
01:20:06,850 --> 01:20:10,050
It adds random points.

1378
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:12,584
And now all the
polygons are triangles,

1379
01:20:12,584 --> 01:20:13,875
and that's much easier to fold.

1380
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:16,590

1381
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:18,636
Or not.

1382
01:20:18,636 --> 01:20:19,760
That's how you would do it.

1383
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:23,010
Anyway, I'm running
out of time, so I'm

1384
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:24,790
going to go back to
the presentation.

1385
01:20:24,790 --> 01:20:27,390
But if you need any
help with these,

1386
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:32,790
or the tutorial with
this program, I'm around.

1387
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:37,490
You can contact me through
the OrigaMIT website,

1388
01:20:37,490 --> 01:20:42,220
or you can come to it an
OrigaMIT workshop on Sunday

1389
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:45,400
and ask me questions then.

1390
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:50,625
So I'm going to quickly just go
right back to the presentation.

1391
01:20:50,625 --> 01:20:53,320

1392
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:56,830
Play slide show.

1393
01:20:56,830 --> 01:20:57,330
Nope.

1394
01:20:57,330 --> 01:21:06,800

1395
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,106
Technical difficulties.

1396
01:21:08,106 --> 01:21:16,560

1397
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,940
Play slide show.

1398
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:23,380
So that was the
example of TreeMaker.

1399
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:26,680
Here's an example of a
non-TreeMaker example

1400
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:30,040
that I designed this
weekend of a crab.

1401
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:34,710
I actually designed
this model it

1402
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:37,050
after I had drawn this picture.

1403
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:42,320
And I wanted to incorporate some
of the elements of this picture

1404
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:43,640
into my design process.

1405
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:46,690
So one of the first
I actually started

1406
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:48,240
was designing the
back so that it

1407
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:49,700
would have this
kind of structure

1408
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:56,910
with this polygon there, kind of
a Komatsu-like design process,

1409
01:21:56,910 --> 01:22:02,126
and trying to make the
final form polygons

1410
01:22:02,126 --> 01:22:04,000
and incorporate those
into my crease pattern.

1411
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,820
So that's what this
area is right here.

1412
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:16,430
It has a very similar structure
to the tree we drew already.

1413
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:20,310
We have the four points for
the legs, the body segment.

1414
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:23,530
These are going to be the eyes.

1415
01:22:23,530 --> 01:22:25,440
And so there are some
extra points just

1416
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,710
to make things easier to fold.

1417
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:29,840
The claws.

1418
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:30,840
Here's the body segment.

1419
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:34,770
There's these extra two
things on either side.

1420
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:37,150
And I made those
so that there could

1421
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:40,920
be an underbelly to
the crab, and that I

1422
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:43,650
could add some texture
in and things like that.

1423
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:46,900
But you can see some
of the constraints

1424
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:50,480
that I've put on it are that
I want this to be 22.5 degree

1425
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:54,430
folding, which is hard to
implement in TreeMaker.

1426
01:22:54,430 --> 01:22:58,380
I've also shown
some of the thinning

1427
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:03,240
to make these points
thinner on the right.

1428
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,790
So if we actually
pick out the tree

1429
01:23:05,790 --> 01:23:09,770
for this hinge
representation, we

1430
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:11,590
get something that kind
of looks like this.

1431
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:13,410
So we have our legs.

1432
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:14,410
Here's our body segment.

1433
01:23:14,410 --> 01:23:19,150
Here are the flaps that I make
into the underbelly, eyes,

1434
01:23:19,150 --> 01:23:21,080
and the claws.

1435
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,769
And here's the folded
proof of concept version

1436
01:23:23,769 --> 01:23:24,810
that I folded last night.

1437
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:26,640
It's actually a
really crappy picture.

1438
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:27,490
I apologize.

1439
01:23:27,490 --> 01:23:30,080
But it's up here.

1440
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:34,090
I fold it like 10:00 last
night, because I thought

1441
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:36,960
it would be useful for you guys
to see what a folded one might

1442
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:37,950
look like.

1443
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:42,590
But it actually turns out
to be somewhat non-uniaxial.

1444
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:45,280

1445
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,160
And you can see some of the
texturing on the underbelly,

1446
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,960
if you take a look at
it and come up here.

1447
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:54,890

1448
01:23:54,890 --> 01:23:59,780
So that's kind of describing
some of the design

1449
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:06,380
process of a real work that uses
the concepts of uniaxial bases,

1450
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:09,370
that I can make this hinge
crease representation,

1451
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:13,000
but then use some
shaping to modify it.

1452
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,280
If you're interested in
learning about anything related

1453
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:19,900
to origami, there's an
excellent online forum

1454
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:24,200
that you can ask questions
or show off work that you do

1455
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,730
or anything like that.

1456
01:24:25,730 --> 01:24:30,675
And if you want to do
something slightly more local--

1457
01:24:30,675 --> 01:24:32,460
this is shameless
self-promotion--

1458
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:37,350
but the origami club at MIT
welcomes you with open arms.

1459
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:39,430
We meet every Sunday
in the Student Center

1460
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:40,450
from 2:00 to 4:00 PM.

1461
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:43,840
You can find all sorts of
details on our website.

1462
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:46,290
So that's about it.

1463
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:48,949
AUDIENCE: Are those
origami letters?

1464
01:24:48,949 --> 01:24:49,990
JASON KU: Those are, yes.

1465
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:52,950

1466
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:57,280
Each one of these
letters was a model.

1467
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:03,820
They're all the same model I
designed, in which you have a 3

1468
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:07,680
by 4 grid of flippable
squares of color change

1469
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:12,120
that you can flip to either
be in the all white state

1470
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:15,830
or all black state.

1471
01:25:15,830 --> 01:25:21,720
And you could also do some
of these half pixeling.

1472
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:27,260
But you can basically make
any of these letters--

1473
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:30,490
I have a whole alphabet of
things-- from a single model.

1474
01:25:30,490 --> 01:25:31,500
I was lazy.

1475
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,670
I didn't want to
design 26 models.

1476
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:35,140
I just want to design one model.

1477
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:39,110
So that that's what those are.

1478
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:40,870
So that concludes the lecture.

1479
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:43,480
We're just about at time.

1480
01:25:43,480 --> 01:26:18,497
