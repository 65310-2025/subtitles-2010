0-1:59:59,500 --> 00:00:03,410

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,270
PROFESSOR: All right!

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,670
Welcome back to 6.849.

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,400
Today, we're going to
move into linkage folding.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,390
And before we get there, I
want to talk about an issue

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,150
that sort of motivates
linkage folding.

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:25,090
And it's about the
definition of folding.

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,015
So we've talked
about origami a lot,

9
00:00:27,015 --> 00:00:28,640
and we've talked
about crease patterns,

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,598
and we've talked about
the folded state-- which

11
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:34,630
is the finished product
after you fold something.

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,770

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,780
But there's another thing
we might care about.

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:53,727

15
00:00:53,727 --> 00:00:55,560
So whenever we wanted
to prove that we could

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,650
fold a piece of paper
in a particular way,

17
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:58,860
we described a folded state.

18
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,640
We said what does the
paper look like in 3D,

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,010
how are the layers stacked,
all these kinds of issues.

20
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,130
But when you fold a
real piece of paper,

21
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,140
you start from a
flat thing, and you

22
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,770
want to continuously deform
it into some 3D shape.

23
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,980
And that is another
kind of folding,

24
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,240
which we call a folding
motion, which we haven't really

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,540
worried about up until now.

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,560
And it's going to be the central
concept in linkage folding.

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,100

28
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,970
The way to define
a folding motion

29
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,240
is just a continuum
of folded states.

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,260

31
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,680
It's a movie.

32
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,580
You start somewhere, usually
we start from the flat folded

33
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,535
state, and then at all times
we specify a new folded state,

34
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:48,420
a new way to fold
a piece of paper.

35
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,630
As long as that's a
continuous process,

36
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,100
then that is a folding motion.

37
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,785
So we've done all
this work proving

38
00:01:55,785 --> 00:01:57,510
that folded states exist.

39
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,580
The question is, what if
I want a folding motion?

40
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,420
Because really, in
order to fold the paper,

41
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,270
I've got to get there.

42
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,830
And that's we're
going to worry about

43
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,913
for the first few minutes.

44
00:02:05,913 --> 00:02:17,790

45
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,290
The good news is the reason we
haven't worried about this up

46
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,120
till now is there's an
equivalence between the two

47
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,060
for paper folding.

48
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,870

49
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:31,790
So if you have-- it's called
a simple polygonal piece

50
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:44,180
of paper, and that
just means your piece

51
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,625
of paper is some polygon,
but it has no holes in it.

52
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,190
It's sort of solid,
there's nothing like this.

53
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,630

54
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:11,570
Then, it has a folding motion
into any desired folded state.

55
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:18,890

56
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,790
So you say, I don't know.

57
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,290
I have this folded state
where all the lines of a swan

58
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,670
are aligned in that
second fold and cut.

59
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:31,080
How do I actually fold
into that folded state?

60
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,750
It's possible.

61
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,130
Any folded state
we describe, you

62
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,910
can reach by a folding motion.

63
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,850
So we're going to prove this.

64
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,060
When you look at it the right
way it's almost trivial,

65
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,200
but maybe a little confusing.

66
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:50,914
So I'll describe the proof to
see what you think about it.

67
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:53,330
I'm going to start with the
case of one dimensional paper,

68
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,240
because it's always
easier to think about.

69
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,380
The idea is the following.

70
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:04,530
You have a piece of paper, and
you have some folded state.

71
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,390
I'm going to draw
a little letter

72
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,270
m, what you want
to fold it into.

73
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,040
They should have
the same length.

74
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,500
We're given this map, we're
told how the piece of paper

75
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,089
folds-- in this case
into two dimensions--

76
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,630
and if there were
any touching layers

77
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,829
here it would be described
which is on the top of which.

78
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,880
We're told how to
instantaneously go

79
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,850
from here to here.

80
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,400
What we're not told is
the steps in between,

81
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,710
and that's what we're
going to fill in over here.

82
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,370
So the idea is rolling creases.

83
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,740
I have my piece of
paper here, and I'm just

84
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,610
going to curl in the
end a little bit.

85
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,110
So I'm going to fold
this thing into--

86
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,520
or I just roll up the end,
I can do this continuously.

87
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,240
It's sort of like the
real piece of paper.

88
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,350
If you start folding
and then pull,

89
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,230
I continuously roll that crease.

90
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,060
At all times, in fact, this
is supposed to stay flat.

91
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,040
It's really hard to
get started in reality,

92
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,790
but in theory, you
can get started

93
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,950
with an infinitesimal
part of the crease.

94
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,930
You just roll it in.

95
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,130
So you make the piece
of paper smaller.

96
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,040
It will be-- geometrically
these are on top of each other,

97
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,710
so it'll be tiny.

98
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,830
So it'll actually be a subset
of the original piece of paper.

99
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,260
You keep doing this,
you end up, let's say,

100
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,564
with a rolled up piece
of paper like that.

101
00:05:28,564 --> 00:05:29,480
A little hard to draw.

102
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,080
Really, it lies along
the line segment,

103
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,100
and you're just going around
and around in a line segment.

104
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,710
But it's like a cinnamon bun.

105
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,100

106
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,990
Why do we bother?

107
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:49,894
Well, if we look at a tiny
piece of this folding--

108
00:05:49,894 --> 00:05:52,060
so in fact I should have
done this at the beginning,

109
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:57,190
let me do that now--
away from the creases.

110
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,630
If I look at a tiny portion,
it's nice and smooth.

111
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,580
I'm not at a crease.

112
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,600
I'm going to highlight which
portion of the paper here ends

113
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,700
up-- this piece of paper's
roughly in quarters.

114
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,120
This is like the third quarter--
that ends up over here.

115
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,150
What I'd really like to
do is roll up everything

116
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,870
to lie on top of that,
so I do some rolling.

117
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:27,250
Maybe this is the-- and
I'm going to roll this up.

118
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,630
So I end up with
the thick segment,

119
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,679
and then some stuff
rolled on top of it.

120
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:37,970
I don't really care too much
what it looks like, I just

121
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,886
need that there's a
continuous rolling process

122
00:06:39,886 --> 00:06:43,280
to get everything to lie
on top of that segment.

123
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,430
Now what I do going down--
this is all in one dimension.

124
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,330
All of this lies
in one dimension.

125
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,840
Now we're going to go
into the second dimension.

126
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,290
Exciting.

127
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:00,810
So we imagine that there's this
M, the folded shape that we

128
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,150
want to build.

129
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,510
And we're going to place it
where the thick part belongs,

130
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,570
where that highlighted
part belongs.

131
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,180
So it belongs
here, and of course

132
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,820
everything comes
along for the ride.

133
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,400
So you've got a little roll
here and a bigger roll here.

134
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,449
Something like that.

135
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:21,990
Just taking that-- or I guess
they were all on the same side,

136
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,320
I'm not drawing
very consistently.

137
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,760
OK, but it's all lying along
this segment of the M. Now

138
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,020
I just need to unroll.

139
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,370
This is where for
the mathematicians

140
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,600
this will become obvious
in a little while.

141
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,890
Maybe, I don't know.

142
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,990
It's kind of a common trick.

143
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,820
So we have this motion
that got us here.

144
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,720
We can obviously play
that motion backwards.

145
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,510
It's symmetric, I could unroll
just as easily as I rolled.

146
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,160
But now what I want to do is
not unroll in one dimension--

147
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,200
if I did that, I'd end
up lying along the line

148
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,306
segment extending this old part.

149
00:07:57,306 --> 00:07:58,930
Actually, it's not
even quite straight,

150
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,470
but let's pretend
it's kind of straight.

151
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:08,790
But now I want to unroll along
the M. So unrolling here,

152
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:12,380
the first thing I would
unroll is this stuff.

153
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,650
It's going to go along the
long direction, the left side.

154
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,970
So it's going to unroll
along, and but instead

155
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,220
of going straight, I want
it to just move along

156
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,830
the M. It's like
I'm an ant, and I

157
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,590
don't realize that I live in
this two dimensional space.

158
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,430
I'm going to pretend that I live
on this one dimensional space,

159
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,179
even though it's not
physically there yet.

160
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:31,970
That's why I drew it dashed.

161
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,220
I just unroll.

162
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:37,820
So I'll end up by the
end-- at this point

163
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,120
I will have this half
of the M, the bold part,

164
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,400
and then this half of the
M hasn't been made yet.

165
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,455
And I'll have a little roll
that's enough to make that.

166
00:08:50,455 --> 00:08:55,240
I unroll more, and I
end up going there.

167
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,665
So it's kind of crazy.

168
00:08:56,665 --> 00:08:58,290
Just roll up the
piece of paper so it's

169
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,660
super tiny so you can put
it on the folded state

170
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,250
without having any creases,
then undo everything

171
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:09,310
you did, but living on the
surface instead of in the line.

172
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,920
So you may or may not believe
that works, but it works.

173
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,440
It's kind of cool.

174
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,770
You can generalize that
to two dimensional paper.

175
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,860
It's a little harder
to draw the diagram,

176
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,120
so I bring the textbook.

177
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,940
Here we have a polygon
of paper, but same idea.

178
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,220
We're going to roll
up that piece of paper

179
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,820
until it's super
tiny-- in this case,

180
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,050
super tiny is a little triangle.

181
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,160
We identify--
actually, ahead of time

182
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,700
we identify a portion, a little
triangle on the surface here,

183
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,270
that does not hit any creases.

184
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,130
Here it is.

185
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,824
And so we roll up the paper to
be contained in that triangle.

186
00:09:45,824 --> 00:09:47,490
Of course, there's
many layers above it,

187
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,240
which you can't-- it's
hard to draw here.

188
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,210
You just curl that
triangle a little bit.

189
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,481
Now it lives on the crane.

190
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:55,980
Here, we're supposing
we want to get

191
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,354
a continuous motion
of the crane.

192
00:09:57,354 --> 00:09:59,730
It's multiple layers,
all sorts of fun things.

193
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,050
And then you just
keep on rolling,

194
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,640
just like you did in the
top thing but backwards.

195
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,340
And instead of
living in the plane,

196
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,130
you now live on
the crane surface.

197
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,157
And the mapping between
them is given to you.

198
00:10:12,157 --> 00:10:13,990
You're given the folded
state that tells you

199
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,110
how the piece of paper
lives on the crane,

200
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,010
and so you just undo
everything on the crane,

201
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,640
instead of in the plane.

202
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,670
On the crane instead
of in the plane--

203
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,720
should be a Doctor Seuss.

204
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,400

205
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,550
Yeah, question.

206
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,840
How do I pick the region?

207
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,360
I just-- in general, we
have some crease pattern.

208
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,354
I just take some region
interior to one face

209
00:10:36,354 --> 00:10:37,270
of the crease pattern.

210
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,670
So just avoiding
creases is all I want.

211
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,420
Yeah.

212
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,770
The level of detail in
describing any region will do.

213
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,110
In reality, we want
it small, so that's

214
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,950
almost flat by smoothness.

215
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,510
But that's sort of
a technical detail.

216
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,114
Other questions?

217
00:10:54,114 --> 00:10:55,780
How many people does
this make sense to?

218
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,380
Just curious.

219
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,040
Yeah, almost everyone
kind of makes sense.

220
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,969
Good.

221
00:11:01,969 --> 00:11:03,260
You have to see it a few times.

222
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,692

223
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:10,950
I remember giving a talk
of this paper in 2001,

224
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:15,092
and I sort of understood it, but
it was a very interactive talk.

225
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:16,300
People kept asking questions.

226
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,480
I think by the end
everyone understood it.

227
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,214
Now I understand it.

228
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:20,880
It's good stuff.

229
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,260
There's some important
open questions, though.

230
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,010
This crucially relies on--
this maybe not so-- well, yeah.

231
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:31,300
If you had a hole in your piece
of paper, this would not work.

232
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,700
Because you can't reduce--
you can't get rid of the hole

233
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,370
by folding.

234
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,130
And you can do all sorts
of rolling, folding corners

235
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,740
over, and making
this thing smaller,

236
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,270
but you'll never be able
to get rid of that hole.

237
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,040
And so this approach
breaks down.

238
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,800
Also, if your piece
of paper was a cube,

239
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,970
the surface of the cube--
like, the end the last class

240
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,870
we talked about
flattening, we had a cube,

241
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,551
and you want to
collapse it flat.

242
00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:55,300
There we know that
there's a folded state,

243
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,580
but we don't know about
the folding motions.

244
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,030
It's kind of disconcerting.

245
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,840
We presume there's
a folding motion,

246
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,710
but again, this
approach doesn't work

247
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:09,010
because you can't get a cube
down to a tiny triangle.

248
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:13,380
You can't get rid of the--
it's kind of like having holes,

249
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,850
but you surround a hole
in the case of the cube,

250
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,560
and you can't get rid of that
topological feature by folding.

251
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,950
So it's tricky.

252
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,440
We avoid collision
throughout here.

253
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,911
We also crease
basically every point.

254
00:12:28,911 --> 00:12:30,660
This is rather impractical
if you actually

255
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,930
want to make something.

256
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,390
It's comforting,
theoretically, but this is not

257
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,030
how you actually fold
a crane, because you

258
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,130
have to do all this
continuous crease rolling.

259
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,350
So over time, every
point of paper

260
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,850
is at some point on a crease.

261
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,620
And a big open problem
is what can you

262
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,386
do with finitely many creases?

263
00:12:47,386 --> 00:12:48,260
I'll write that down.

264
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,820

265
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,680
Let's suppose you have no
overlapping layers of paper,

266
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,115
to make life a
little bit easier.

267
00:12:56,115 --> 00:12:59,000

268
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,220
So the paper doesn't
touch itself, so to speak.

269
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,030
Can you do a finite
number of extra creases?

270
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:12,600

271
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,540
I would conjecture
maybe yes, but this

272
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,760
is a challenging problem.

273
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,870
Here we have sort of
infinitely many creases.

274
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,120
Everything becomes a crease.

275
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,420
The extreme form
of this is what we

276
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:31,785
call rigid origami, where
you have no extra creases.

277
00:13:31,785 --> 00:13:34,510

278
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:39,760
So you're supposed to
just use the creases that

279
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,990
are given to you in
the crease pattern,

280
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:49,740
and the faces of the crease
pattern are rigid polygons.

281
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,560
They have to stay flat
throughout the folding motion.

282
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,330
So rigid origami
is a thing about

283
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:58,470
ridge-- about folding motions,
not about folded states.

284
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,610
I have some folded
state I want to get to,

285
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,230
can I get there
with rigid polygons?

286
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,610
And the creases now
become hinges, basically.

287
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,160
If you're making
origami out of metal

288
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,520
with flat sheets,
or plastic polygons,

289
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,600
whatever, hinging them together.

290
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,950
Can use still fold this thing?

291
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,620
Or did folding it
require this kind

292
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,360
of bending the
paper in crazy ways,

293
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,670
putting creases
all over the place?

294
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,870
Sometimes you can do this,
most of the time you can't.

295
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,610
And there's a lot we don't
know about rigid origami.

296
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,960
I have one simple example.

297
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,260
Something we know is bad,
which is kind of fun.

298
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,480
Should have brought an
actual paper shopping bag.

299
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,060
You take a paper shopping
bag, they're mass produced

300
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,230
in this crease pattern,
so they're produced flat,

301
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,860
I believe.

302
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:54,360
And can't be folded,
doesn't fold rigidly.

303
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,360
You just have these
creases-- the edges

304
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,880
of the bag, this
kind of simple thing.

305
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,890
It looks like straight skeleton
over here, and a perpendicular.

306
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,830
Looks very nice from a
fold and cut standpoint.

307
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:09,794
And it does have a folded
state, which is flat.

308
00:15:09,794 --> 00:15:10,960
There's no way to get there.

309
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,480
If you look at all the
possible folded states

310
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,550
of this pattern with rigid
panels, there are two.

311
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,880
There's the 3D state
you should see here.

312
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,609
There's the flat state.

313
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:24,650
There's nothing that could
possibly connect them.

314
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,240
There are no other states,
so there's no folding motion

315
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,750
from one to the other.

316
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,990
You could
instantaneously be flat,

317
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,600
and you could
instantaneously be open,

318
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,610
but you can't do
anything in between

319
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,960
without curving the paper
or doing something invalid

320
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,320
according to rigid origami.

321
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,980
So obviously you don't want to
make a paper shopping bag out

322
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,160
of metal, I guess is the
lesson, without adding

323
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,215
extra creases at least.

324
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:50,690

325
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,190
Yeah.

326
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,664

327
00:15:54,664 --> 00:15:57,080
I would love to find more open
questions on rigid origami,

328
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:02,160
but so far we've just looked
at a few small things.

329
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:08,920
But this turns us
over to linkages,

330
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,810
which are all about finding
these motions without making

331
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,485
extra creases.

332
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:16,340

333
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,600
So I need to introduce a
little bit of terminology.

334
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,510
This is like creases
and all those things

335
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,550
from the origami world.

336
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,620
But we care about various
levels of linkages.

337
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,270
Let me remind you,
in general a linkage

338
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:33,040
is going to be something
like these guys.

339
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,500
This is the Peaucellier
linkage, these guys

340
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,780
were pinned to the
projector screen,

341
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:42,040
these guys were flexible,
these are rigid bars,

342
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,370
and this guy ended up
tracing a straight line

343
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,760
as this thing moved.

344
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,194
So that's the thing we want
to map-- model mathematically.

345
00:16:49,194 --> 00:16:50,860
We're going to have
zero thickness, just

346
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,240
like with paper folding.

347
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,260
We're going to have vertices,
where things come together.

348
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:02,568
And we're going to have edges,
which are those rigid bars.

349
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:04,609
And I'm going to try to
speak in two languages at

350
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,840
once-- the fairly
intuitive one, and I'm

351
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,589
going to use some
notation in parentheses.

352
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,450
So if you follow
the math, great.

353
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,920
If not, also fine.

354
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,369

355
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,569
The graph is just
combinatorial structure.

356
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:22,400
It just says, look, I've
got things joined together

357
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,900
like this.

358
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,829
There's no geometry,
there's just

359
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:28,090
a sense of what edges are
joined together at vertices.

360
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,330
It's an abstract thing, kind
of like the shadow trees

361
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,340
we work with.

362
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,070
They're not really
embedded anywhere,

363
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,240
though here, you don't
even have lengths.

364
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,980
Linkage, you assign lengths
to the edges, and that's it.

365
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:47,440
So I take a graph and then
I add lengths to edges.

366
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,390

367
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:53,230
Its lengths of edges.

368
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,630
So in math, this
would be a function l

369
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:59,970
that maps every edge to a
non-negative real number.

370
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,910

371
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,560
And I might want
a little bit more.

372
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,690
So this is sort of optional.

373
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,220
You might have some
pinned vertices,

374
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,780
things that are not
allowed to move.

375
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:18,190
So you might add coordinates
for pinned vertices.

376
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:24,990

377
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,730
And so in math, this
would be a function p

378
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,750
that maps some subset
of the vertices E

379
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:34,265
prime to wherever
you happen to live.

380
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:37,510

381
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,920
So here, I'm supposing our
linkage lives in d dimensions,

382
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,950
because we're going to think
about linkages in 2D today.

383
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,730
We're going to think about
linkages in 3D, linkages in 4D,

384
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,240
and higher.

385
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,920
Everything is fair game.

386
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,440
We're going to be
pretty general.

387
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,730
And sometimes, I want to
think about the linkage

388
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,175
as this abstract thing.

389
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:55,950
It tells me how
things are connected,

390
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,200
tells me what the lengths are.

391
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,830
This is again like
a shadow tree.

392
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,210
Maybe I'm also told
some vertices are pinned

393
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,862
in particular places in the
plane or in 3D or whatever.

394
00:19:04,862 --> 00:19:07,070
But sometimes I want to
forget about that extra stuff

395
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,420
and just think about the graph.

396
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,270
We won't do that
till next lecture,

397
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:14,890
but I mention it now
because we will need it.

398
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,575
And then where
the real action is

399
00:19:17,575 --> 00:19:20,650
is in the configuration
of a linkage.

400
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:23,880
And that's the geometry,
that's how the thing is folded.

401
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,385
This is basically a
folded state for linkages.

402
00:19:26,385 --> 00:19:32,757

403
00:19:32,757 --> 00:19:34,840
Why is it different
terminology than folded state?

404
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:41,030
Just because it's a
different sub-field, I guess.

405
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,917
Avoid confusion with
the other notions.

406
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:45,750
With folded states,
usually we allow creases

407
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,530
all over the place.

408
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,363
With the linkage, you're
really only allowed

409
00:19:48,363 --> 00:19:50,990
to bend at the vertices,
so it's a bit special.

410
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,890

411
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,660
So a configuration
just gives you

412
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,710
coordinates for every vertex.

413
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,690

414
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,400
So we would say configuration
C maps every vertex

415
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,716
to some point in d
dimensions, and you

416
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:11,340
have to satisfy a
bunch of constraints.

417
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:24,130

418
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,470
And the constraints are
given by the linkage,

419
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,120
so you've got the lengths
and you've got the pinning.

420
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,040
So you have to have that.

421
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,770
If you look at two vertices
that are connected by an edge,

422
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,890
that edge has a
length, the distance

423
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,950
between those two
points should be

424
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:47,780
equal to the length of that edge
as given by that function l.

425
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:59,570
This is for phi w an edge, and
then for the pinned vertices

426
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,600
the point you choose
better be exactly what's

427
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,865
given by the pin function.

428
00:21:02,865 --> 00:21:10,990

429
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,600
Never mind the details,
it's pretty intuitive.

430
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,330
But link-- whenever
I say linkage,

431
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,650
I mean the abstract thing.

432
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:21,760
Configuration, I mean actually
embedded in whatever space

433
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,630
you're living in.

434
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,103
So let's do a simple example.

435
00:21:25,103 --> 00:21:36,520

436
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,050
Basically, the simplest
linkage that you can think of

437
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:45,170
is a square, and abstractly just
a bunch of vertices and edges.

438
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,440
This is the graph.

439
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,400
I haven't written down anything.

440
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:55,610
When I add lengths-- let's say
they're all the same length,

441
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,845
I want to represent a square--
that becomes a linkage.

442
00:21:58,845 --> 00:22:01,600

443
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,100
And maybe I also specify this
guy is at coordinates (0, 0);

444
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,490
and this guy is at
coordinates (1, 0), that's

445
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,177
one unit away from this point.

446
00:22:12,177 --> 00:22:13,760
So that would sort
of pin things down,

447
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,120
and these guys are
still available to move.

448
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,870
This is of course not
a valid drawing, not

449
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,411
a valid configuration
of the linkage.

450
00:22:19,411 --> 00:22:21,210
The lengths aren't
all the same, this guy

451
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,190
looks longer than this one.

452
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:26,290
But then a valid configuration
would be an actual square.

453
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:29,660

454
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,030
I should draw in the plane.

455
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:36,670
Let's say-- so this is
at (0, 0); this is at (0, 1);

456
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,220
this is (1, 1); (1, 0).

457
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,879
So that's a configuration.

458
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:43,920
There are a bunch of
configurations this linkage.

459
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:50,590
For example, that would
be another configuration.

460
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:54,721
And there's a whole
degree of freedom here.

461
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:57,220
And we really care about all
those different configurations.

462
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,990
We call that the
configuration space.

463
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,260

464
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,730
Configuration space is the
set of all configurations.

465
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,760

466
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,920
So it has one thing
for the square,

467
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,560
there's one thing for this
particular parallelogram,

468
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,640
and there's that whole picture.

469
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:24,200
Why don't I show you
graphically what it looks like?

470
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,710
So here we have a
square-- square, move.

471
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,600
There we go.

472
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,930
So yeah, it's flexible.

473
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,770
That vertex C is
moving around a circle.

474
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,720

475
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,270
We can go around, and
around, and around.

476
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,790
All right, you get the idea.

477
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,248
Are there any other
configurations?

478
00:23:44,248 --> 00:23:47,160

479
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,410
No or yes.

480
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,230
Pick one.

481
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,035
Yes is correct.

482
00:23:50,035 --> 00:23:52,950

483
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,950
Ah, yeah, there.

484
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,130
So when I get to here
and everything's sort

485
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,320
of overlapping--
little hard to see,

486
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,340
but you see there's
the yellow and green.

487
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,200
Then I can bend--
and this I can't

488
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,380
do in the way this
program's set up-- I

489
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,130
can now move d
without moving AB.

490
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,860
I could move the segment
BD and spin that around.

491
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,980

492
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,390
So in fact, if you think
about it for a while--

493
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,860
I hope I got this
right, because I

494
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,570
think every time I've
given this lecture

495
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:25,110
I draw a different picture.

496
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,040
The space, the
configuration space,

497
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:35,275
it looks something like
three kissing circles.

498
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:38,070

499
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,742
So it's not quite
drawn to scale.

500
00:24:40,742 --> 00:24:42,450
Each of these points
I want to correspond

501
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,460
to one configuration.

502
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,540
I should really draw this
with more board room.

503
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:58,670

504
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,910
All right, so we
started with the square.

505
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:05,340
And let's say these are the
pinned guys on the bottom.

506
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,630
I had this one circle
of motion, which

507
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,760
just moved this segment
around sort of in a circle.

508
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,280
So at the opposite point would
be where these guys are pinned

509
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,850
and the square is inside out.

510
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:23,590
And halfway along
would be I don't know,

511
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:27,620
let's say I'm going left
here, I've got this,

512
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,170
and then my square is over here.

513
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,710

514
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,540
Draw the right number
of points, yeah.

515
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:38,560
And over on this side would
be these are the pinned guys,

516
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,090
and my square is over there.

517
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,120
From here, I can
do another circle

518
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,410
of motion, which is I can
never move these points,

519
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:50,460
but now I can turn
this guy around.

520
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,110
And when I go halfway
around it will

521
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,480
be sort of folded on itself.

522
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,180
So these are the
pinned guys, and then

523
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,450
the polygon's like that,
all on top of itself.

524
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,840
We're only thinking about
where the vertices are,

525
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,940
we're not thinking about
overlap order here, one

526
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,860
of the differences
with linkages.

527
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,340
And if I go around
from this guy,

528
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,610
it turns out-- I'm pretty
sure these circles of things

529
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:20,030
are different except right here.

530
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:26,890
And so this thing is
equal to this thing.

531
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:31,495
So hence, three circles
that, pairwise, kiss, I

532
00:26:31,495 --> 00:26:33,019
think is the topology
of this space.

533
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:34,310
You can walk around this thing.

534
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,860
It was a little hard to
draw, but in this very simple

535
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,310
example, we can draw effectively
how the configuration

536
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:43,600
space works, how you
can navigate operations.

537
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,210
In general, I want points
in the configuration space

538
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,570
to correspond to
configurations of the linkage.

539
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:54,310

540
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:58,490
and I want paths in
the configuration space

541
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:02,197
to corresponds to motions.

542
00:27:02,197 --> 00:27:04,780
This is actually the first time
we get a definition of motion.

543
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,170
I haven't specified one
here, although motion is just

544
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,980
going to be a continuum
of configurations,

545
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,720
just like we had with paper.

546
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,420
In the configuration
space, a motion

547
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,600
is just some path
through the space.

548
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,600
You start at some point.

549
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,050
You end at some point.

550
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,846
There may be multiple
ways to get there,

551
00:27:20,846 --> 00:27:22,470
but if your thing is
connected, there's

552
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,842
a way to get from
anywhere to anywhere.

553
00:27:24,842 --> 00:27:26,300
We want to understand
the structure

554
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,390
of paths in that space.

555
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,650
That's motions.

556
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,950
That's how you can get places.

557
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,510
Mathematically, I guess
this is one big parenthesis,

558
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:47,260
you can think of a conflagration
of an n-vertex linkage

559
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,210
as a bunch of coordinates.

560
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:55,530
You've got the coordinates
for the first vertex,

561
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:58,000
coordinates for v_1, so
if we're in d dimensions,

562
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,060
there's going to be
d of these things.

563
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,250
So you've got, x, y, whatever.

564
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:05,700
Then you could write down
the coordinates for v_2.

565
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,200
Let's say we're in
three dimensions.

566
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,550
So we've got three
here, three values here.

567
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,412
I'm not going to write
down what they are,

568
00:28:12,412 --> 00:28:14,120
because I don't know
what they are-- then

569
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,620
three values for
the third vertex,

570
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:24,420
and so on for n vertices.

571
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,930
Why is this useful?

572
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,870
Because you can think
of a configuration,

573
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,550
specify all these coordinates.

574
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,655
How many coordinates in total?

575
00:28:32,655 --> 00:28:37,420
It's d times n numbers.

576
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:40,630
You can think of a configuration
as just d times n numbers.

577
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,610
So you can think
of a configuration

578
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:52,490
as a point in d times
n dimensional space.

579
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,580
So this is giant space.

580
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:59,890
Like for our square, I drew it
as a two-dimensional diagram,

581
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:03,270
but in reality
there's four vertices.

582
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,730
Each has two dimensions.

583
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:08,500
So it's an eight-dimensional
space-- a little hard

584
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,090
to imagine.

585
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,380
But it's so constrained--
you can't just

586
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,780
take any set of numbers here.

587
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,940
They have to satisfy the
edge length conditions,

588
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,030
and they have to satisfy
the pinning constraints.

589
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,650
And by the end, the space
is locally one-dimensional.

590
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:26,980
It lives in eight
dimensions, but you can only

591
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:31,570
move along
one-dimensional curves.

592
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,910
So we say this
configuration space

593
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,170
or that these configurations
have one degree of freedom.

594
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,962

595
00:29:39,962 --> 00:29:41,420
And "degree of
freedom" is probably

596
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,880
a term you've heard before.

597
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,880
It's used all over the place.

598
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,630
And the formal notion
of degree of freedom

599
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:50,890
here is just, locally, how
many dimensions do you have

600
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:54,410
if you look at the paths
going out from where you are?

601
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,880
If, for example, I have
just a free segment,

602
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,751
it's got a bunch of dimensions--
a bunch of degrees of freedom.

603
00:30:00,751 --> 00:30:02,250
It can translate,
and it can rotate.

604
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,742
I guess, three.

605
00:30:03,742 --> 00:30:05,450
If I pin one of the
vertices, now it only

606
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,533
has one degree of freedom.

607
00:30:06,533 --> 00:30:08,120
It can spin around.

608
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,550
Just locally, how many
different ways can you move?

609
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,169
What is the dimension
of your space?

610
00:30:13,169 --> 00:30:14,960
And a lot of the time,
we care about things

611
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,150
that have only one
degree of freedom

612
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,560
because they're controlled.

613
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,990
We get to say what they do.

614
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:22,510

615
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,220
All right.

616
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:27,836
Let's move on to something
interesting about all this,

617
00:30:27,836 --> 00:30:29,970
which is Kempe's
Universality Theorem.

618
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:59,300

619
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,400
So this is the result that
you can sign your name, so

620
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,620
to speak, but I'll
state it more formally.

621
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:09,340

622
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:15,590
My input is an algebraic
planar curve, and all of this

623
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,180
can be generalized to
beyond two dimensions,

624
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,870
but I'll start with
the planar case.

625
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:36,840

626
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,040
Let me get back to that.

627
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,970

628
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:44,160
Think of that as
just this blind,

629
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,490
some kind of polynomial curve.

630
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:51,240

631
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:56,950
We're going to restrict that
curve to a bounded disk,

632
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:01,520
then claim that is
exactly the trajectory

633
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,390
of some vertex in a linkage.

634
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:22,224

635
00:32:22,224 --> 00:32:22,740
OK.

636
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,910
So I have a lot of
things to define here.

637
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:29,540
One of them is trajectory.

638
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,160
So this is pretty intuitive.

639
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,360
So for example, you take some
linkage like this square,

640
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,630
and as it moves, you just
follow one of the vertices.

641
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:42,710
So for example, if we look
at c, the trajectory of c

642
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:47,340
is this white circle, at
least as we move to here.

643
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,800
I think even here, when
we move d, c doesn't move.

644
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,700
So the trajectory
of c is that circle.

645
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,060
It's just-- you take
all the configurations,

646
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,119
but then you just
focus on one vertex

647
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,660
and see where it
can go in the plane.

648
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:06,150
In general, it can be very
complicated, like here, maybe.

649
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,330
Yeah.

650
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:11,379
You may recall it seems
I do this every time.

651
00:33:11,379 --> 00:33:13,920
If you look at the trajectory,
this is not actually a vertex,

652
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,350
and that is not a valid color
if you want to see something.

653
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,740

654
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,580
This vertex, for
example, its trajectory

655
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,640
is some kind of figure
eight curve like that.

656
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,020
In general, it can
be some crazy curve,

657
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,600
and we want that crazy curve
to match a given planar curve.

658
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,390

659
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,700
What is this notation?

660
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:42,580
All I mean, it's just
something like 3 x cubed times

661
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:52,130
y minus 7 y to the
fourth power equals 0.

662
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,680
You can also add 23 to it.

663
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,712
Whatever.

664
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,840
So you have some equation.

665
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,330
This is an equation on points.

666
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,640
In general, if you
think about it,

667
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,360
you've got two degrees
of freedom for a point.

668
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,640
It has an x coordinate
and a y coordinate.

669
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,670
You add one equation,
one constraint,

670
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,545
that effectively pins it
down to be one-dimensional.

671
00:34:10,545 --> 00:34:12,670
So it's going to define
some one-dimensional curve.

672
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,750
It could be very general.

673
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,560
It could even be disconnected.

674
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,090
All sorts of weird stuff.

675
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,860
But you can use this to write
down circles and ellipses.

676
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,560
That's the quadratic
polynomials.

677
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,570
But you could also write much
more complicated things here.

678
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:30,010
So this defines some
crazy curve, locally

679
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,860
one-dimensional thing.

680
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,400
And it may also go off to
infinity if there's hyperbolas,

681
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,444
or whatever, in there.

682
00:34:36,444 --> 00:34:38,610
We're not going to try to
capture the infinite curve

683
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,068
because that's
actually impossible.

684
00:34:40,068 --> 00:34:43,130
If you have any pin
vertex, then you

685
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,830
can only get so far away
from that pin vertex.

686
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,380
If you have no pin
vertices, then you

687
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,191
can show you can make
any point in the plane.

688
00:34:50,191 --> 00:34:51,940
So if I want to get a
one-dimensional set,

689
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,790
it's got to be a bounded
set from a linkage.

690
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,990
So I take some big
disk that captures

691
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:01,610
the stuff I care about in
that one-dimensional curve,

692
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:04,890
and then I am going to
trace out everything

693
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:09,340
of that curve inside that disk
using one vertex of a linkage.

694
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,610
That's my goal.

695
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,220
So it's a pretty
powerful result.

696
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,950
I like to call it Kempe's
Universality Theorem

697
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:23,350
because Kempe wrote a paper
about it in 1891 or so-- 1876.

698
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:26,050
Even earlier.

699
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,110
He didn't really prove
the theorem, though.

700
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:33,860
Kempe is quite famous for
two wrong proofs of theorems,

701
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,390
but the theorems are true.

702
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,960
The one he's most famous for
is the four color theorem,

703
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,126
which you may have heard of.

704
00:35:39,126 --> 00:35:42,020
Any plane or map can be
colored with four colors

705
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,750
such that no two
countries share boundary

706
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,410
if they have the same color.

707
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,460
He didn't prove that theorem,
but it was the late 1800s.

708
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,360
It wasn't proved
until 1960 or so.

709
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:59,040
But the technique he used is
called the discharging method,

710
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,650
is the proof that
people use today.

711
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,090
There are now two proofs
to the four color theorem.

712
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,590
They both use discharging.

713
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:07,560
So they both use Kempe's ideas.

714
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,090
He was just ahead of his time.

715
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13,387
He also claimed to
prove this theorem.

716
00:36:13,387 --> 00:36:15,720
And he proved a slightly
weaker version of this theorem.

717
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,900
I'm going to show you his
proof because it's nice,

718
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,130
and it can be fixed,
actually, relatively easily--

719
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,900
although that was done only in
the context of this class six

720
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,430
years ago.

721
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,060
So Kempe's proof has been
around for over 100 years.

722
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,560
Other people had
proved this theorem

723
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,311
but in more complicated ways.

724
00:36:31,311 --> 00:36:33,060
We can prove it in the
same way Kempe did,

725
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,185
just a little bit of extra.

726
00:36:34,185 --> 00:36:42,247

727
00:36:42,247 --> 00:36:44,830
So the rest of the lecture will
be about proving that theorem.

728
00:36:44,830 --> 00:37:06,150

729
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,280
All right.

730
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,320
So we've got two things
we need to worry about.

731
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,965
We have to worry
about this curve,

732
00:37:10,965 --> 00:37:13,290
and we have to worry about
being in a bounded disk.

733
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,660
I like being in a bounded disk.

734
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,820
That sounds really easy.

735
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,310
Let's start with that.

736
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:20,400
So this is this figure.

737
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,590
I have, just for fun, a scan of
the original Kempe paper where

738
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,139
he draws the
corresponding gadgets.

739
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:26,430
This is, again, a gadget proof.

740
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,950
We're going to have lots of
cool gadgets to do fun things.

741
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:32,320
A rhombus looks like this.

742
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,700
It has one pin vertex,
a, here, and you

743
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,604
have a degree of freedom in
how you specify this thing.

744
00:37:38,604 --> 00:37:41,020
You specify the lengths of the
edges, but all of the edges

745
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,870
have the same length.

746
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:48,010
So it's like a square, except
I only pin one of the vertices.

747
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,620
That's really the same thing.

748
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:53,840
And you can see, it can only
go out to twice that distance,

749
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,104
and then it fails
to exist out here.

750
00:37:56,104 --> 00:37:58,520
These figures are drawn using
a program called Cinderella,

751
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,340
which is very, very cool.

752
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:04,520
It's commercial, but
you can download a demo

753
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,440
and make your own fun
constructions like this.

754
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,490
These are all on the web,
the ones I drew here.

755
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,610
So you can see,
basically, that point b

756
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:14,820
is constrained to lie in a disk.

757
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,740
That's it.

758
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,480
Very simple.

759
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,610
So that's the rhombus gadget.

760
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:29,190

761
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,940
But I want to think
about it a little bit.

762
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:37,450

763
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,024
So this vertex is pinned,
let's say, at 0,0.

764
00:38:40,024 --> 00:38:42,190
Well, I guess it's pinned
at the center of the disk.

765
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,900
I don't know where that is.

766
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,060
This vertex is going to be
the vertex I care about.

767
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,830
It's the one that I want to
force to lie on the curve

768
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,180
and trace out the curve.

769
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:55,300
This is going to
be my magic vertex.

770
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,270
Let's call it (x, y).

771
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,830
Say the point that
it lives on is (x, y).

772
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:03,330

773
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:08,010
I somehow have to evaluate this
multinomial, various powers

774
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,050
of x and y, multiply
them by some constants,

775
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,580
add them together, and
force that to equal 0

776
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,634
by some constraint, by
adding-- bars, in general,

777
00:39:14,634 --> 00:39:15,300
are constraints.

778
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,240
Edges are constraints.

779
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,470
They give me
equality constraints.

780
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,345
I say the distance
between these two vertices

781
00:39:20,345 --> 00:39:21,860
is equal to something.

782
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,420
Somehow I have to set up the
distance between two vertices

783
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,950
to be that crazy
function that I'm given.

784
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,300
It could be anything.

785
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,010
It could be a mess.

786
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:34,850
So Kempe had this cool idea.

787
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:38,910
He said, look, you
can write this point

788
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:44,650
as a sequence of motions,
you can think of them.

789
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,770
So you start at the
origin here, and then you

790
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,520
move along this segment,
and then you move

791
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,560
along this segment.

792
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,435
So let's just write
down-- what's that angle?

793
00:39:52,435 --> 00:39:53,200
Call it alpha.

794
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,670
Let me be consistent
with my notation.

795
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,590
Yes, alpha.

796
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:01,100
And these are horizontal lines.

797
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,964
And you can think of this
angle-- I'll call it beta.

798
00:40:04,964 --> 00:40:06,130
So there's some length here.

799
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,590
Did I give it a name?

800
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,690
I do.

801
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:13,210
I call it r/2, because
if these are both r/2

802
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,940
and these are also r/2-- that's
the definition of a rhombus--

803
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,680
then this point
can get to anywhere

804
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,140
within a disk of radius
r centered at this point.

805
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,370
So this would be the
center of the disk.

806
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:27,850
So we're given r, we're
told what the disk is.

807
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:28,700
We set this up.

808
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,950
But now alpha and beta
are in some sense free.

809
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,375
They're actually
related to-- no,

810
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:35,000
they're not even
related to each other.

811
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,960
This point still has
two degrees of freedom.

812
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,027
Even though it can't
go out to infinity,

813
00:40:40,027 --> 00:40:41,610
it can move in x and
it can move in y.

814
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:44,040
We saw because only
one point was pinned,

815
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,560
it could float around in
a two-dimensional space.

816
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:52,530
So alpha and beta are actually
both free to some extent.

817
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,710
So instead of
coordinatizing by (x, y),

818
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,770
you could coordinatize
by alpha and beta.

819
00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:00,780
And you can relate those two
coordinatizations by some trig.

820
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,265

821
00:41:03,265 --> 00:41:04,890
I'm going to cheat
here because I never

822
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:07,490
remember which is sine or
cosine without thinking

823
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:08,230
for 30 seconds.

824
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:12,000

825
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,810
The way I remember
is always cosine

826
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:16,500
is alphabetically
smaller than sine,

827
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,380
and so cosine is
the x coordinate

828
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:21,950
and sine is the
y coordinate, if you

829
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:24,170
draw the triangle in the
conical orientation, which

830
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:24,878
you might forget.

831
00:41:24,878 --> 00:41:32,447

832
00:41:32,447 --> 00:41:34,030
If you were given
these angles and you

833
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,446
want to construct
this point, it's

834
00:41:35,446 --> 00:41:37,790
like, well, I go
in this direction.

835
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:40,710
That direction is cosine
alpha, sine alpha.

836
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:43,470
And I go that direction
for r/2 distance.

837
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:48,820
So I have r/2 times cosine alpha
in the x coordinate, r/2 sine

838
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,945
alpha in the y coordinates.

839
00:41:49,945 --> 00:41:51,920
It's nice and alphabetical.

840
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,110
Then from there, I
go in this direction,

841
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:57,530
which is in the beta
direction-- the cosine beta,

842
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,480
sine beta direction.

843
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,360
I go that direction by
the same amount, r/2.

844
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,177
So there you go.

845
00:42:03,177 --> 00:42:05,260
That's x and y written in
terms of alpha and beta.

846
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,840

847
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,040
For the purpose of this exercise
I prefer cosines over sines.

848
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,970
So I'm going to
rewrite these sines

849
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:15,940
in terms of cosines
in the obvious way,

850
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:27,380
which I will look up, which
is cosine alpha minus pi/2,

851
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:31,860
Those r/2 cosine
beta minus pi/2.

852
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,670

853
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,066
OK.

854
00:42:36,066 --> 00:42:38,660
Let's see if I can successfully
draw cosine and sine.

855
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,720
Sine starts here and does that.

856
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,060
Cosine starts here
and does that.

857
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,840
They're just shifts
of each other, which

858
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,867
I didn't draw so beautifully.

859
00:42:48,867 --> 00:42:49,700
Something like that.

860
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,150

861
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,590
Cosine and sine,
just a shift by pi/2.

862
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:58,330
So if I subtract
pi/2 from the angles,

863
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:04,160
I can turn it into a
cosine instead of a sine.

864
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:04,850
Great.

865
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,820
So I have x and y
written as cosines

866
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,210
of things involving
alpha and beta.

867
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:10,970
So what?

868
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:17,030
Well magically, when I think
about squaring or raising

869
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:21,660
x to some power like 10, if
you look in angle space what

870
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,240
happens to alpha
and beta, it's kind

871
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,210
of like multiplying
the angles by 10.

872
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:29,170
In some sense, going into
the trigonometric world

873
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:31,424
is like taking logarithms
if you're into algebra.

874
00:43:31,424 --> 00:43:33,840
You have these exponents, and
they're hard to think about.

875
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,506
You take logs, it's
just multiplication.

876
00:43:35,506 --> 00:43:37,010
No biggie.

877
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:40,210
And for those of you who
know complex analysis,

878
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:41,565
that should be obvious.

879
00:43:41,565 --> 00:43:44,510
For the rest, just
take it on faith,

880
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:46,890
and we'll just find
out that it's true.

881
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,320
Because you have
this good friend.

882
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,582

883
00:43:52,582 --> 00:43:54,230
You have the product
of two cosines.

884
00:43:54,230 --> 00:44:02,970

885
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:07,571
You can rewrite it in terms of
adding and subtracting angles.

886
00:44:07,571 --> 00:44:09,320
Now, you may not have
learned it this way.

887
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,480
You probably learned
about rules for cosines

888
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,770
of sums of things and cosines
of differences of things.

889
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:18,550
If you take these two
expansions, add them together,

890
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,590
lots of things
cancel, and you end up

891
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:24,890
just being left with cosine a
times cosine b, modulo

892
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:27,020
a factor of 2.

893
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:31,270
So in our situation, we
have this crazy thing.

894
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:34,660
Let me write down another
one-- x to the seventh times y

895
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:40,610
squared plus whatever,
maybe times 6 here.

896
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:41,930
Well, I know what x and y are.

897
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:43,000
I just expand them.

898
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,230
I can just plug in
this thing involving

899
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:48,430
cosine alpha and cosine beta
into x, and plug in this thing

900
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:53,000
involving cosine of alpha
minus pi/2 and so on into y.

901
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,320
Multiply all that stuff out.

902
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,900
What you end up doing is
multiplying cosines times

903
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,320
cosines.

904
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,460
And here's how we do it.

905
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:03,330
To multiply two cosines, I
absorb things and turn it

906
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:08,580
into cosines of sums of angles
and differences of angles.

907
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,390
And I brought an
example for you.

908
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:14,672

909
00:45:14,672 --> 00:45:16,690
I'm from Waterloo,
so I use Maple.

910
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:21,560
You could use Mathematica,
whatever you want,

911
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,940
because doing this
algebra is a pain.

912
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,090
But at the top there, it
says substitute x equal

913
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:29,500
that crazy thing and y
equal that crazy thing.

914
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:33,220
Here I didn't bother
rewriting in terms of cosines

915
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:37,460
because Maple's smarter than I
am, so I don't need to do that.

916
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,610
And I have some crazy
equation at the top

917
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:42,560
there, which is x cubed
times y minus 5 times x times

918
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,400
y squared equals 0, but I'm
ignoring the equals 0 part.

919
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,400
So I just plug that in, and the
first time, the first answer

920
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,650
there, it doesn't do anything.

921
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:53,240
It just plugs it in.

922
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:57,670
Then I say expand that, and
it does all this crazy stuff.

923
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:00,970
It multiplies all those things
out, uses binomial theorem

924
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:01,470
or whatever.

925
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:03,261
You get various new
coefficients out there,

926
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,580
but you get various powers
of cosines and sines

927
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,930
of alphas and betas.

928
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,190
And then I use the
magic operation

929
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:12,397
Combine Using Trig Formulas.

930
00:46:12,397 --> 00:46:14,730
And combine means when you
have a product of two things,

931
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,250
try to make it one thing.

932
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,760
And that's just a way of telling
Maple to apply this formula,

933
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,300
but it does it for the sine case
also-- both cosines and sines.

934
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:28,480
And then you get this pretty
equation, or pretty left-hand

935
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,980
side I guess.

936
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,580
You get sines.

937
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,584
It's written it as
sines and cosines.

938
00:46:33,584 --> 00:46:35,000
In our situation,
we're only going

939
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,740
to get cosines because I
was very reductionist here.

940
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:41,600
And it'll always be cosines
of various integer multiples

941
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:46,000
of alpha plus some
integer multiple of beta.

942
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,655
And then there'll be some
power of r out there.

943
00:46:48,655 --> 00:46:49,280
It's no biggie.

944
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,780
In fact, we're told what r is.

945
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,330
We don't have to
think very hard.

946
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:55,110
We can construct r
to the seventh power.

947
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:56,844
It's not a big deal.

948
00:46:56,844 --> 00:46:58,260
In fact, all of
these coefficients

949
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,140
are not a big deal.

950
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:02,200
We can just say 15
over 32 times r cubed.

951
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,660
We can just make an
edge that's that length.

952
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,940
The hard part is making
these things because alpha,

953
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,260
beta are variables.

954
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,680
They're not a fixed thing.

955
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,420
As this thing moves, we want to
be able to compute twice alpha

956
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:17,510
plus beta, and then take
the cosine of that thing.

957
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:19,460
Now taking the cosine
of a thing is easy.

958
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,900
It's just the x coordinate.

959
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:28,400
If I have a segment that's
going in direction theta,

960
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,890
then the x coordinate
of this thing

961
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:33,010
with respect to that
thing is cos theta.

962
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:34,760
This is what I've been
using all the time.

963
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,760
The y coordinate is sine
theta, but x coordinate

964
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,980
is cosine theta.

965
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,510
So if we can construct something
at an angle of twice alpha

966
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:44,800
plus beta, then we just
project onto the x axis.

967
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,550
This length is cosine theta.

968
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:49,060

969
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:49,780
Done.

970
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,080
So all we need is to be
able to take an angle,

971
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,440
multiply it by some
integer like 27,

972
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,882
and we need to be able to
add two angles together.

973
00:47:58,882 --> 00:48:00,700
And that's what Kempe does.

974
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,250

975
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:07,340
So he does it with
this crazy thing

976
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,440
called a contraparallelogram.

977
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,960

978
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,360
A parallelogram looks like this.

979
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,636
You see the parallelogram.

980
00:48:16,636 --> 00:48:18,510
So it's a little more
general than a rhombus,

981
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:19,310
but not much more.

982
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:22,790
And then the contraparallelogram
is you take this diagonal,

983
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:26,250
a,y I guess it's called here,
and you reflect one side down.

984
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:28,850
And so the blue thing is
the contraparallelogram.

985
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:31,770

986
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:33,330
How does it work?

987
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:34,630
What does it do?

988
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:36,840
Well, I'm assuming the
left point there is pinned.

989
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,430
Actually, I'm assuming
both x and y are pinned.

990
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:42,420
And it just moves around.

991
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,390
It's kind of cool.

992
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:46,420

993
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:50,685
It has this great
feature that the angle

994
00:48:50,685 --> 00:48:54,120
at a here between
the two blue segments

995
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,650
is the same as the angle at y.

996
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:00,665
And the angle at x is the
same as the angle at b.

997
00:49:00,665 --> 00:49:02,920
You can see that
throughout the motion.

998
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,989
So it's basically
an angle copier.

999
00:49:05,989 --> 00:49:07,530
Angle copier sounds
good because if I

1000
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:10,050
want to multiply an angle by
2, I'd like two copies of it

1001
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:12,090
and then stick them together.

1002
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:15,004
So we're just going to take
this contraparallelogram

1003
00:49:15,004 --> 00:49:19,690
and combine a bunch of them.

1004
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:23,780
So if we're going
to multiply by 2--

1005
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:26,350
it's a little harder
to see right on blue.

1006
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:29,530
So I have one
contraparallelogram here,

1007
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:33,800
and then I make a similar--
you just scale it up--

1008
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,800
contraparallelogram that
lies along that one.

1009
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,300
So there's two
contraparallelograms.

1010
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,990

1011
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:44,920
And as I said
before, this angle is

1012
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,510
going to be equal to this angle.

1013
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:48,440
That's going to be
our input alpha.

1014
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,180
And we're trying to
compute twice alpha,

1015
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,340
which will be here.

1016
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,880
And because this
contraparallelogram

1017
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,170
is similar to this one,
the angles are the same.

1018
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,950
It's just a blowing up of it.

1019
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:02,970
So that means these angles,
which are equal to each other

1020
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:04,690
because it's
contraparallelogram,

1021
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:07,850
will be equal to these
angles because it's

1022
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:10,110
the same contraparallelogram
scaled up.

1023
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:13,262
Therefore, we have two copies
of the angle right there.

1024
00:50:13,262 --> 00:50:15,840
I'll just show
you that it works.

1025
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,610
A little hard to see on a
digital screen with pixels.

1026
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:19,110
Here.

1027
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:21,526
When we get 90 degrees, we're
going to get the twice of it

1028
00:50:21,526 --> 00:50:23,310
is exactly 180.

1029
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:25,900
Here's 45.

1030
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:29,430
Here's two 30s
make 60, and so on.

1031
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:32,510
It works basically all the time.

1032
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:34,830
Wow, cool.

1033
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:37,490
It's hard to see in some cases.

1034
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:43,260
I guess there, twice 180
is making 360, and so on.

1035
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:46,730
That's how you
multiply an angle by 2.

1036
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:50,120
But then you can extend that and
just repeat this construction.

1037
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,720
I take one contraparallelogram,
I attach it

1038
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,570
to another similar
contraparallelogram,

1039
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:57,077
I attach that to another
similar contraparallelogram,

1040
00:50:57,077 --> 00:50:58,410
I get three copies of the angle.

1041
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:03,310

1042
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,020
Amazing.

1043
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,590
Here's trisecting
180 degree angle.

1044
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:08,385
I get three 60s.

1045
00:51:08,385 --> 00:51:11,240

1046
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,920
Wow, that looks crazy.

1047
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,230

1048
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:17,617
But it works.

1049
00:51:17,617 --> 00:51:19,200
This is sort of a
proof that it works.

1050
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,670
It exists in all the states.

1051
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:23,280

1052
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:23,780
Great.

1053
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,230
This is an angle
trisector, which

1054
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:27,370
was a big deal in
the late 1800s.

1055
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:29,760
You could build a linkage
where if-- instead

1056
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,570
of thinking of this
as being your input,

1057
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:34,153
or this, whatever-- any one of
these three could be the input,

1058
00:51:34,153 --> 00:51:36,000
and the output is
three times that.

1059
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,250
That's what we want.

1060
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:40,260
You could turn it around and
say, if I'm given some angle,

1061
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,710
I line up these two bars
to be equal to that,

1062
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:46,200
and then I'll get three
trisections of the angle.

1063
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,917
You can use this to
quintisect an angle.

1064
00:51:47,917 --> 00:51:49,500
You can divide into
any integer number

1065
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,280
parts using this crazy linkage.

1066
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,500
Fun stuff.

1067
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:58,250
And we can use it to multiply
an angle by some constant.

1068
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:03,190
I should write, we
do this, we expand,

1069
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:05,660
and we will get
a bunch of terms.

1070
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:10,490
We will get that our
function phi here

1071
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:12,890
is a sum of a
bunch of terms that

1072
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:15,800
look like some constant,
which we can compute ahead

1073
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:23,260
of time nothing's changing,
times cosine of some integer,

1074
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:31,880
what do I call it, it's
to match minutes here,

1075
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:40,180
r sub i times alpha,
plus s sub i times

1076
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:43,650
beta, plus some
magic number delta,

1077
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:48,979
and delta is 0, or plus
or minus pi over 2.

1078
00:52:48,979 --> 00:52:50,020
So that's not a big deal.

1079
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,870
That's just saying whether
we're using sign or cosine.

1080
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,550
What we need is to
construct, and these

1081
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:58,301
are both integers could
be positive or negative,

1082
00:52:58,301 --> 00:52:59,800
negative's not such
a big deal, it's

1083
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,140
just you look at the
angle the other way.

1084
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:06,270
So we need some integer times
alpha, some integer times beta,

1085
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,750
we can now do that.

1086
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:10,180
Then we need to
add them together.

1087
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,870
How do we do that?

1088
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:13,480
We use the Kempe Additor.

1089
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,820

1090
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,510
There he is drawing it.

1091
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:22,980
we drew a slightly more detailed
diagram, looks like this.

1092
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,480
Now, this is a
little more confusing

1093
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,190
so I had to label the thing.

1094
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:29,820
We've got the x axis,
I like that part.

1095
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:32,110
The idea is we have two inputs.

1096
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:35,460
Here's input one, defining
one angle to the x axis.

1097
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,080
Here's input two, another
angle to the x axis,

1098
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,491
here is about 90 degrees.

1099
00:53:39,491 --> 00:53:40,990
I want to add them
together and that

1100
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:44,420
will be this output over here.

1101
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:49,030
Our idea, I think I should
draw this separately,

1102
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:52,200
not our idea this is
Kempe's idea, here's

1103
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:56,040
0 here's input
one, and input two.

1104
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,460
Both of these are measured
as angles to the x axis.

1105
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:03,760
All we need to do is sort of
rotate this angle to be here,

1106
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,440
and then this guy
will be the sum.

1107
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,510
How do we figure that out
when all we know how to do

1108
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:16,270
is multiply angles by two or
divide them in half let's say?

1109
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:17,690
I told you that.

1110
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:19,830
You think about it
for a while, you

1111
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:22,920
realize, oh well
let's instead think

1112
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,779
of it as taking this
angle the smaller one,

1113
00:54:25,779 --> 00:54:27,320
doesn't really matter
but it's easier

1114
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:30,070
to think about copying
that angle over here.

1115
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:31,620
I want to copy that
angle over here,

1116
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:35,540
and I'm an origamist
I think reflection.

1117
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:39,850
I would really like to
reflect along the bisector.

1118
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:42,110
Now what is it a bisector of?

1119
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:45,830
It's a bisector of this angle,
which hasn't been marked here.

1120
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:51,430
But if this a, this is b,
then this would be b minus a.

1121
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:58,015
So I want to bisect that angle.

1122
00:54:58,015 --> 00:54:59,390
Really I want to
bisect the angle

1123
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:03,066
between this edge and this edge.

1124
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:04,090
How do I do that?

1125
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:07,830
I use a Kempe
multiplicator, value of two,

1126
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:12,500
apply it to this angle, then
I figure out that bisector.

1127
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,750
How do I copy this
thing over to here?

1128
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:18,810
Well I take this
angle and I double it,

1129
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:22,660
I'll get that, actually that.

1130
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,980
So I just used two
Kempe doublers,

1131
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:28,980
one to have been one to double.

1132
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,730
And I can we
possibly see it here?

1133
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:33,480
I have this line marked middle.

1134
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,030
That is the bisector between
the input two line and the input

1135
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:37,080
one line.

1136
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,450
How is it found?

1137
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:42,250
Well it's here.

1138
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:48,860
That's one part of the Kempe
halfer, doubler, whatever.

1139
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:52,300
And it's attached to one
over there, similar one.

1140
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,630
So it's attached on one side to
input two and on the other side

1141
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:57,730
to input one.

1142
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:00,460
And so therefore it
actually takes that angle

1143
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,450
and it cuts it in half there.

1144
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:03,720
That's what it does.

1145
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,250
So now I have that
middle line and I

1146
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:09,260
have another Kempe doubler
which is attached to the output

1147
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:13,730
thing, and the middle, and
it's attached to the x axis

1148
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:14,580
to ground it.

1149
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,880
So now we're taking this
angle and doubling it

1150
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,170
and that gives us the output.

1151
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:24,580
And you do it, and magically
thanks to Cinderella,

1152
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,750
it does the right thing.

1153
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:28,920
So as I move, here I'm
changing input one,

1154
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,290
and I'm moving the output
and also this middle line,

1155
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:35,180
it's staying a bisector there,
when they both get to 90

1156
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:37,250
it'll be 180, and so on.

1157
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:40,900
And I can change
and put two as well.

1158
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,550
And once you build it it's kind
of clear that it will work.

1159
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:46,782

1160
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:48,240
There's a special
case of doubling,

1161
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,170
but I can add any
two angles I want.

1162
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:52,910
And what's fun is it also
works, I set it up for input one

1163
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,640
being smaller input
two, but it works just

1164
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,077
as fine the other way around.

1165
00:56:57,077 --> 00:56:58,910
I don't want to go too
big because I get out

1166
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:02,380
of the screen.

1167
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:05,850
There's 0 adding 0 to something.

1168
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:07,380
Cool, huh?

1169
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,400
Like magic.

1170
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,620
So Kempe was really smart.

1171
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,370
He knew about these linkages.

1172
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:13,460
He wrote that book How
to Draw a Straight Line.

1173
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:15,034
But he knew a lot
more about then

1174
00:57:15,034 --> 00:57:16,200
how to draw a straight line.

1175
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:21,160
He could use, he could
add two angles, man.

1176
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,780
Very cool.

1177
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:26,210
All right, what's left.

1178
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,990
Basically done,
for Kempe's proof.

1179
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:31,190
I haven't told you what's
wrong with this proof yet.

1180
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:34,785
Maybe you've been
thinking about it.

1181
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:37,330
Then you just have to put
all these gadgets together.

1182
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:41,300
We have a schematic
of it in the textbook.

1183
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:46,075
So we started at the
top with our rhombus.

1184
00:57:46,075 --> 00:57:48,880
Not really drawn like a
rhombus there, but pretend it's

1185
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,030
a rhombus, this guy.

1186
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:56,802
I guess this is simplified
since we drew this figure.

1187
00:57:56,802 --> 00:57:58,260
So all the edge
links are the same.

1188
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,242
We've got that
point p at the top,

1189
00:58:00,242 --> 00:58:01,450
that's the one we care about.

1190
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:05,589
We've got the O in the bottom
left, it's pinned to the table.

1191
00:58:05,589 --> 00:58:07,380
And there's one gadget
I didn't talk about,

1192
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:09,900
translators which is copies,
angles around, not too

1193
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,310
big a deal.

1194
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:14,650
Then we, in this case
say, we take alpha,

1195
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:19,030
it's right there, we multiply
it by two, get two alpha,

1196
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:22,420
take beta maybe add those two
together, we'll get twice alpha

1197
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:24,560
plus beta.

1198
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,470
And that is some angle
we want to measure

1199
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:31,510
the x coordinate of the
segment with that angle.

1200
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:35,696
So we just make this thing
have the right length.

1201
00:58:35,696 --> 00:58:36,820
What length should it have?

1202
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:40,440
Well we have this
cosine of whatever

1203
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:45,180
of our angle in
our formula here.

1204
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,280
And there's some
constant in front of it.

1205
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,800
And for whatever reason
we have this constant 3a

1206
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:53,110
squared times b, something
that we know how to compute.

1207
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:56,667
So we just make this edge
have that length, that's

1208
00:58:56,667 --> 00:59:00,210
a scale marker, and
measure the projected

1209
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:02,447
x length of that thing.

1210
00:59:02,447 --> 00:59:05,030
Well, in fact in general we have
a whole bunch of these terms.

1211
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:07,320
We need to add them together.

1212
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,860
We have a whole bunch of these
things you saw on the Maple,

1213
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,620
had I don't know, 20 of those.

1214
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:15,530
So we just string them together.

1215
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:18,540
That's our thing we start at
some point, which we call 0.

1216
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:22,350
In fact, it will be the
same as that O, let's say.

1217
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,776
It should be the same as that O.

1218
00:59:23,776 --> 00:59:26,150
We're going to measure relative
to the center of the disk

1219
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:30,770
say, wherever (0, 0) is.

1220
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:34,132
And then we want to measure
how long this thing gets in x.

1221
00:59:34,132 --> 00:59:36,090
Some of these terms might
actually be negative,

1222
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:38,580
some are positive.

1223
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:41,540
But we're effectively adding
up all of these weighted sums

1224
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,660
of cosines of our
angles which we

1225
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:46,330
compute through
these crazy things.

1226
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:50,000
At the end we want this to be 0.

1227
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,350
So our goal is to make the
sum of all these things, which

1228
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:56,270
is the sum of all these
things rewritten, equal to 0.

1229
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:59,140
That was the definition
of our curve.

1230
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:00,340
How do we force it to be 0?

1231
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:03,760
Well the actual value is
the x coordinate here.

1232
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,270
And I'm going to
force this to lie

1233
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:09,470
on x equals 0 using a
peaucellier linkage,

1234
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:12,029
because it forces
points to line a line.

1235
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:13,570
In the way we drew
it, it would force

1236
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:16,670
it to be on a vertical line.

1237
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:19,200
So you have to imagine this
picture a little differently,

1238
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,830
because in fact
this should be at x

1239
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:23,570
equals 0, which is
normally right here.

1240
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:25,480
So this thing actually
goes over to the right

1241
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,940
and we'll get positive
and negative values

1242
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:31,660
and it should lie along
the vertical line there.

1243
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:36,010
And that's how you force, now
this point p prime has nothing

1244
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:38,170
to do with them, is
not the same as p.

1245
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:40,420
But we computed it based
on all these things

1246
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,200
in terms of alpha and beta.

1247
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,720
So this is a constraint
on p in the end,

1248
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,620
because p determined
all these things.

1249
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:49,780
And either this thing will
be on the line or not.

1250
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,771
And we add this one
equality constraint

1251
01:00:51,771 --> 01:00:53,395
which would be exactly
this constraint.

1252
01:00:53,395 --> 01:00:57,700
It will constrain p
to lie on that curve,

1253
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:00,875
and that's Kempe's construction.

1254
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:01,375
Questions?

1255
01:01:01,375 --> 01:01:06,200

1256
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,310
Three cool, just slightly wrong.

1257
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:11,600
Any ideas what's wrong?

1258
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:22,630

1259
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:24,180
Has nothing do
with this picture.

1260
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,065
It has everything to
do with the gadgets.

1261
01:01:26,065 --> 01:01:31,460

1262
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:34,860
And actually it really has
to do with all this business

1263
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:36,610
about the square.

1264
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,840
I've lost my diagram of
the configuration space

1265
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:39,640
to the square.

1266
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:43,110
We had this thing that
when the square was flat,

1267
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:45,060
it could fold in a new way.

1268
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:47,282
And you saw I couldn't
even do that in Cinderella.

1269
01:01:47,282 --> 01:01:48,740
Cinderella is
designed to find sort

1270
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:51,970
of one primary
arc of this thing.

1271
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:56,650
But there are these
branch points, these guys.

1272
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:59,020
And this construction
is perfect if you always

1273
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:01,000
stay on your track.

1274
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,640
But in a real linkage, you
can diverge at any point

1275
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,422
and go to some other track, and
you can walk around this space.

1276
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:08,380
When you have these branch
points where there's

1277
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:12,340
more than two curves coming
together, you have a choice.

1278
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:15,640
So you're not supposed
to have a choice here,

1279
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:18,750
supposed to always
do this thing.

1280
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:25,530
And sadly there's one
gadget, really two gadgets,

1281
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:27,670
the parallelogram and
the contraparallelogram.

1282
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:30,040
The parallelogram
we're using here.

1283
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:33,300
It's also used in the copy
gadget which I didn't show you.

1284
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:39,730
What don't I tell you, a
copy gadget looks like this.

1285
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:44,860
It's like a lamp, you
know like the Pixar lamp.

1286
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:49,710
So if you have an angle here
it gets copied here, right.

1287
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:52,309
These are just two
identical parallelograms.

1288
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:54,100
So if you need multiple
copies of an angle,

1289
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:55,930
you can make multiple
copies that way.

1290
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:59,832
I don't think you really
need this, but Kempe used it.

1291
01:02:59,832 --> 01:03:02,960
It feels good to be
able to copy an angel.

1292
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,790
And it's a parallelogram.

1293
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:07,450
And we used a lot, the
contraparallelogram.

1294
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,050
The trouble is they
are the same linkage.

1295
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:12,820
If you forget about
the configuration,

1296
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:14,970
you just look at the linkage
which is who's pinned,

1297
01:03:14,970 --> 01:03:17,830
what are the edge links, what
is the graph connectivity,

1298
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:22,432
it looks like this, just these
numbers are not all the same,

1299
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:24,140
and only one of these
vertices is pinned.

1300
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:26,080
Other than that it's
exactly this diagram.

1301
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,370
You know, It's a square,
it's a quadrilateral,

1302
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:31,230
has some lengths.

1303
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:34,150
Opposite pairs are equal.

1304
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:38,280
But you can't really
distinguish from the two

1305
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,450
kinds of configurations.

1306
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:41,490
There's one track which
is the parallelogram.

1307
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:43,823
There's another track which
is the contraparallelogram.

1308
01:03:43,823 --> 01:03:45,560

1309
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,080
And you can do this.

1310
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:52,910
Let me show you in animation,
give you some intuition.

1311
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:55,700
So here I drew both, oh sorry,
not supposed to move that.

1312
01:03:55,700 --> 01:04:01,270
Here I drew both of them, got
the green contraparallelogram.

1313
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:05,630
And there's the, sorry green,
the blue contraparallelogram.

1314
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:08,650
And then we've got the
black and blue parallelogram

1315
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:09,770
on the outside.

1316
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:13,690
And ignore this diagonal, it
should be a different color.

1317
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:17,860
And when we're flat,
that's the same thing.

1318
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:20,470
And so we've got this one
cycle that goes around

1319
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:22,380
and that's the blue picture.

1320
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:25,450
Then at this point you can
switch into the black picture

1321
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:29,920
and follow the parallelogram
around until it's flat.

1322
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,380
And that point you could also
switch back to blue or not.

1323
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:37,090
So I think this is two
circles joined to two points.

1324
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:39,840
If I'm not mistaken,
the configuration space

1325
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,920
would look like this.

1326
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,374
So one of these tracks, say this
one, is a contraparallelogram.

1327
01:04:45,374 --> 01:04:46,540
This one is a parallelogram.

1328
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:50,730
They meet at the two
extremes, both flat cases.

1329
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:54,750
And in Kempe's construction
he wants each of the things

1330
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:56,860
that we call the
parallelogram like this one,

1331
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:58,627
to stay on one, the
parallelogram track.

1332
01:04:58,627 --> 01:05:00,210
And he wants the
contraparallelograms

1333
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:03,450
to stay on the
contraparallelograms track.

1334
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:05,550
But how do you force that?

1335
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:08,620
He didn't force it,
and so technically he

1336
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:10,050
did not solve this problem.

1337
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:12,992
He solved, that
solved this problem,

1338
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:14,450
which is that you
would get exactly

1339
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:16,250
the trajectory of a vertex.

1340
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:19,550
He solved the slightly weaker
problem, which is his point

1341
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:22,430
can travel along that curve.

1342
01:05:22,430 --> 01:05:25,160
It can also travel
on other curves.

1343
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,660
But it's going to
be one dimensional

1344
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:27,880
because it is constrained.

1345
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,130
But there are these other
tracks you might conceivably

1346
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:31,440
be able to go on.

1347
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,179
In particular, you
can follow this track.

1348
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,345
There might be other things.

1349
01:05:34,345 --> 01:05:36,550
And we'd like to
get rid of that.

1350
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:39,250
It turns out you can get
rid of that pretty easily.

1351
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:42,790

1352
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:45,840
This problem was first noticed
by Kapovitch and Millson

1353
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:52,150
in like 2002 I think.

1354
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:53,470
Yeah.

1355
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:55,220
Well that's when it
finally got published.

1356
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:57,940
I think it was around for
a few years before that.

1357
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:02,230
And they observed that
for parallelograms you

1358
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:05,550
can fix it pretty easily
like in this picture.

1359
01:06:05,550 --> 01:06:08,730
You have the
parallelogram a-b-c-d.

1360
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:11,540
You construct the
midpoints of a and b

1361
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:13,440
and the midpoints of d and c.

1362
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,410
How do you actually do this?

1363
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:18,990
I want that point x to stay
on the middle of that bar.

1364
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:20,520
You can do that
by making, if you

1365
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:22,860
want to construct a point
in the middle of a bar,

1366
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:25,130
you just add a tiny
triangle, where

1367
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:29,880
it's forced to be that
way, where a b equals,

1368
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:33,690
I mean the sum of a
and b equals a plus b.

1369
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:37,477
And if you want,
do we need this?

1370
01:06:37,477 --> 01:06:39,560
I think you could just
construct those three bars.

1371
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,800
This makes a little
bit more rigid,

1372
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:46,550
but I don't think we
actually need that here.

1373
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:49,000
So you can force a vertex
to be along the midpoint

1374
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,620
there by making a tiny
triangle, a zero area triangle.

1375
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:57,980
And when you do that, I don't
actually have a picture of it,

1376
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:01,570
we can look at the
countra-parallelogram I guess,

1377
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:04,552
it forces the thing to work.

1378
01:07:04,552 --> 01:07:06,510
So for example, suppose
we go from the midpoint

1379
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:08,920
here to the midpoint there.

1380
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:12,190
That's going to stay parallel to
this segment and this segment.

1381
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:14,540
It's like two parallelograms
joined together.

1382
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:17,560
Okay, and if you went
here, and then you

1383
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:22,389
tried to go off into the
contraparallelogram state,

1384
01:07:22,389 --> 01:07:23,180
what would that do?

1385
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:26,280
Well you'd have like from
the midpoint of this segment

1386
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,850
to the midpoint of this segment.

1387
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:29,820
Holy cow.

1388
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:31,980
It's like they're right
on top of each other.

1389
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:33,855
So that's not going to
have the right length.

1390
01:07:33,855 --> 01:07:36,710
Right now it's supposed to be
this length, same as the length

1391
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:38,540
a x.

1392
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:41,280
So if you try to jump
tracks you can't.

1393
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,060
It's really easy to force
to stay on the parallelogram

1394
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:44,560
track.

1395
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,620

1396
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:49,760
And then six years
ago in this class

1397
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,570
I posed, hey can we
do the same thing

1398
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:53,142
for the contraparallelogram.

1399
01:07:53,142 --> 01:07:55,350
Kapovich and Millson gave
some other very complicated

1400
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:56,480
solution.

1401
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,840
Turns out there's also
pretty easy way to fix

1402
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:04,820
the contraparallelogram, which
is you add this pinpoint set up

1403
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:07,180
to be-- So these midpoints
will all be aligned

1404
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:09,450
because it's a
contraparallelogram.

1405
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:11,400
You take the middle
and you bisect,

1406
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:15,560
you put x far away, it would
be very far down there.

1407
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:19,040
And you just make these
lengths be what they should be.

1408
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,899
And it's not so
obvious but you can

1409
01:08:20,899 --> 01:08:23,660
prove that as the
contraparallelogram moves,

1410
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:26,898
these edges will all
have the same length.

1411
01:08:26,898 --> 01:08:29,270
It works.

1412
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:35,200
Whereas if you try to go
into the parallelogram state,

1413
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,740
and you measure
these links, they're

1414
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:37,939
going to be really tiny.

1415
01:08:37,939 --> 01:08:39,800
Here they're really large.

1416
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,460
Am I doing that right?

1417
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:42,550
What am I measuring?

1418
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:45,000
No, the point is it's
not about those links.

1419
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,479
These guys have to be collinear
in the contraparallelogram

1420
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:51,300
case, but they are not collinear
in the parallelogram case,

1421
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:54,140
and this is essentially
forcing that collinearity.

1422
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:56,640
So I don't want to go into the
details of how that's proved,

1423
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,130
it's in the textbook.

1424
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:01,560
But this bracing will force it
to say contraparallelogram,

1425
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,080
that bracing will force
it to be a parallelogram,

1426
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,029
and then we actually
have proofed

1427
01:09:06,029 --> 01:09:08,530
Kempe's universality theorem,
with just a slight tweak

1428
01:09:08,530 --> 01:09:09,420
to his proof.

1429
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:12,910

1430
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:15,270
So that's the bug and the fix.

1431
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:17,930
Let me tell you some
generalizations,

1432
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:19,710
some open problems,
some applications.

1433
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:28,319

1434
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:31,569
Maybe start with
the obvious stuff

1435
01:09:31,569 --> 01:09:37,490
which is something called
Weierstrass approximation

1436
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:57,250
theorem, which is that if you
have any continuous function,

1437
01:09:57,250 --> 01:10:03,590
I should say let's
think of it as a curve,

1438
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:09,650
has an epsilon approximation
as a polynomial.

1439
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:15,450

1440
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:17,030
OK, so in particular
what this tells

1441
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:19,290
us is if we have some
crazy curve we want

1442
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:24,330
to make, like a signature,
then you can approximate it

1443
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:29,170
by a polynomial of the form that
we analyzed, this phi

1444
01:10:29,170 --> 01:10:33,740
of x y equals 0.

1445
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:35,840
And the polynomial will
actually look like this,

1446
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,540
It's a little bit
ugly, if you've ever

1447
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:39,480
seen these constructions.

1448
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:44,430
But it will be always within
an epsilon thickness of Erik,

1449
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:48,270
always Erik, never
any other curve.

1450
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:50,810
All right so you can apply
this to make your signature

1451
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:53,462
or make whatever crazy
curve you have in mind.

1452
01:10:53,462 --> 01:10:54,295
That's kind of nice.

1453
01:10:54,295 --> 01:10:56,820

1454
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:59,265
So this is why you can sign
your name using polynomials.

1455
01:10:59,265 --> 01:11:01,890

1456
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:03,399
So that's an easy application.

1457
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:04,273
Some generalizations.

1458
01:11:04,273 --> 01:11:12,776

1459
01:11:12,776 --> 01:11:13,760
All right.

1460
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:19,840
You can do curves
in d dimensions.

1461
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,020
We talked about two dimensions.

1462
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:23,630
You can generalize that.

1463
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:28,030
You can also do surfaces
in d dimensions.

1464
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:30,940
Basically if you want to specify
a curve in three dimensions,

1465
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:35,320
you need two equations
to constrain it down

1466
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,949
to a one dimensional thing.

1467
01:11:36,949 --> 01:11:38,490
Generally you start
with d dimensions

1468
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:40,656
and you can remove however
many dimensions you want.

1469
01:11:40,656 --> 01:11:42,210
You'll get some
subsurface in there.

1470
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:44,360
Just add a bunch of
polynomial constraints.

1471
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,850
You can do that.

1472
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:49,020
Other fun facts.

1473
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:54,352
The number of edges you
need is about n to the d.

1474
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:58,460
This is being careful
about reusing structure.

1475
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:01,450
In the plane you can deal
with n squared edges.

1476
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:02,550
And that's optimal.

1477
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:04,300
You can show you
need n squared edges

1478
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:08,890
to construct certain
polynomials in the plane.

1479
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:13,060
In three dimensions you're
going to need more, turns out.

1480
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:15,040
Basically, because the
constructions we used

1481
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,920
want to work in a plane, and
if you live in d dimensions,

1482
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,540
you have to add lots
of edges to force

1483
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:22,870
it to live in two dimensions.

1484
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:27,510
So you can do the computation,
add the numbers, and so on.

1485
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,898
What other good things?

1486
01:12:29,898 --> 01:12:32,610
All right, for the
mathematicians,

1487
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:38,950
you can make any compact
semi algebraic set.

1488
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:43,520

1489
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,400
It's basically a
fancy way to say

1490
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,935
you can add polynomial
constraints,

1491
01:12:47,935 --> 01:12:51,110
but you can also take
unions of solution sets.

1492
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:53,030
So I could take the
union of five curves

1493
01:12:53,030 --> 01:12:57,025
that I like, or I can take the
intersection of five curves

1494
01:12:57,025 --> 01:12:58,530
that I like.

1495
01:12:58,530 --> 01:13:00,490
Bunch of things
you can do, that's

1496
01:13:00,490 --> 01:13:02,510
the meaning of semi
algebraic set, polynomials

1497
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:03,635
and union and intersection.

1498
01:13:03,635 --> 01:13:07,590

1499
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:12,300
These are all proved in paper
with Tim Avit and Reid Barton

1500
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:14,730
from this class six years ago.

1501
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:19,210
Another fun fact
from that paper is

1502
01:13:19,210 --> 01:13:22,940
that it's coNP-hard
to test rigidity.

1503
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:26,190

1504
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:30,430
Rigidity is the
topic of next class.

1505
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:32,960
You're given a linkage,
does it move it all?

1506
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,450
And you can use
these constructions

1507
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:37,660
to mean, to show that something
will move at all if and only

1508
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:39,940
if all these polynomials
have a solution.

1509
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:43,020
And that turns out
to be really hard.

1510
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:45,610
And it's something
called coNP-hard,

1511
01:13:45,610 --> 01:13:47,610
which is almost the
same as NP-hard.

1512
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:50,670
it's just for rigidity,
it's really easy

1513
01:13:50,670 --> 01:13:53,030
to prove that something is
not rigid, you just move it.

1514
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:55,520
It's a little harder to show
that it can't move in any way.

1515
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,560
So that's for those who know
coNP, it's coNP, not NP.

1516
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,320

1517
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,070
Cool.

1518
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:05,050
Those are various
generalizations.

1519
01:14:05,050 --> 01:14:08,790
Big open problem
here is what if you

1520
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:11,139
forbid the edges from crossing.

1521
01:14:11,139 --> 01:14:12,680
This actually came
up in lecture one.

1522
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:13,450
Someone asked it.

1523
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:18,686
It was first posed that I know
from Don Shimamoto in 2004,

1524
01:14:18,686 --> 01:14:20,480
I was giving a talk.

1525
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,380
And all these
constructions, especially

1526
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:24,610
the contraparallelogram,
need to have

1527
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:26,747
edges that cross each other.

1528
01:14:26,747 --> 01:14:28,330
Next class will also
be about the case

1529
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:29,710
where edges cross
each other but soon

1530
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:31,006
we are going to
enter the case where

1531
01:14:31,006 --> 01:14:32,297
edges are not allowed to cross.

1532
01:14:32,297 --> 01:14:34,150
Can you do any of
this stuff, construct

1533
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:36,000
any interesting polynomials?

1534
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,320
Even constructing a straight
line, I think is open.

1535
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:41,250
The peaucellier linkage
definitely doesn't work.

1536
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:42,750
Maybe there are
some other linkages,

1537
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:44,070
we'd have to check them.

1538
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:46,690
But definitely Kempe's
universality result

1539
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:50,540
is open for non-crossing edges.

1540
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:52,314
I have some fun
projects like it'd

1541
01:14:52,314 --> 01:14:53,730
be fun to implement
this algorithm

1542
01:14:53,730 --> 01:14:55,777
and see this thing run.

1543
01:14:55,777 --> 01:14:57,860
You could build a sculpture
out of Kempe linkages.

1544
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:59,670
They're a little
bit tedious I would

1545
01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:02,310
say to make interesting curves,
but there's some cool ones.

1546
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:06,810
Like in the notes I have a
link to the letter C made out

1547
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:07,800
of a linkage.

1548
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,360
You could do a whole
alphabet, be kind of fun.

1549
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,310
Have these things cranking
around and spelling

1550
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:17,560
all sorts of, actually spelling
names would be the idea.

1551
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:21,260
Another fun application that I
thought I would just throw in.

1552
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:24,240
If you are, back to origami.

1553
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:27,160
Origami can in some
sense simulate linkages.

1554
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,931
And the motivation for
this is you've, you

1555
01:15:28,931 --> 01:15:31,430
know you've designed, you just
design all these awesome

1556
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:35,000
TreeMaker diagrams for
your problem set.

1557
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,160
And you realize, oh
man, there's points

1558
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,230
all over the place on
this piece of paper.

1559
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:41,211
How the heck am I
going to find, if I

1560
01:15:41,211 --> 01:15:42,960
had to make origami
diagrams, first I say,

1561
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,300
oh you do this step, then
this step, then this step.

1562
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:49,990
How am I going to tell someone
oh, just fold to root 3 over

1563
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:54,280
7 comma root 5
plus root 7 over 4,

1564
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:56,010
Which you could figure
out in some sense

1565
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:58,920
from those geometries what
all those coordinates are.

1566
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:02,710
How do you tell
someone to fold there?

1567
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:06,040
Well, you could
use a polynomial.

1568
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:09,850
Could say oh, you've
got to construct root 5.

1569
01:16:09,850 --> 01:16:11,040
Or what's a tough one?

1570
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:14,120

1571
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:19,940
Let's say you want to compute
the fifth root of 103.

1572
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:20,920
Is that prime?

1573
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,750
I think so.

1574
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:25,160
So some nasty thing like this.

1575
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:28,010
You say oh well, I
would really like

1576
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:31,390
x to the fifth to equal 103.

1577
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:33,830
If I could solve
this polynomial,

1578
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:36,009
then I could
construct this number.

1579
01:16:36,009 --> 01:16:37,300
How do I solve that polynomial?

1580
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:40,360
Well I'm all about solving
polynomials using linkages.

1581
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:43,080
I could build a crazy
linkage device out

1582
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,550
of my piece of paper.

1583
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:46,530
Don't try this at home, please.

1584
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:50,620
But in theory, you could come up
with these n really long bars,

1585
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:53,760
fold them around, and
think of them as linkages.

1586
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:58,240
And you tell people, oh well you
just need to align these dots,

1587
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:02,490
you may make little pinches on
at the ends of these things,

1588
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:04,830
those simulate the
edges of your linkage.

1589
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:07,850
And then you just tell people
to move these creases around

1590
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:11,140
until this point
lies on some line.

1591
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:13,750
And then you've solved
your polynomial.

1592
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:15,640
And this is a natural
generalization

1593
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:18,290
in some sense to something
called origami axioms, which

1594
01:17:18,290 --> 01:17:20,270
we will probably talk
about at some point.

1595
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:22,350
Usually you think about
doing one fold at a time.

1596
01:17:22,350 --> 01:17:24,485
You want to make one fold
so that this point maps

1597
01:17:24,485 --> 01:17:26,610
onto this line, and this
point maps onto this line.

1598
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:28,610
That's the typical
origami axiom.

1599
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:29,350
It's pretty good.

1600
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:31,480
It can trisect angles
and it can do fun things.

1601
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,192
But it can really only
solve degree four equations.

1602
01:17:34,192 --> 01:17:35,900
You want to solve a
degree five equation,

1603
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:38,050
you need some higher
level techniques.

1604
01:17:38,050 --> 01:17:40,340
And one way to do that is
with Kempe's universality.

1605
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:44,410
It's pretty impractical,
but at least in theory you

1606
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:48,350
can do anything, you can
locate any point you want,

1607
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:50,320
any algebraic point,
which are the things you'd

1608
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:56,692
want from tree maker, using
this technique, little crazy.

1609
01:17:56,692 --> 01:17:58,150
There are other
ways to do it, too.

1610
01:17:58,150 --> 01:18:01,185
But this one way to do it,
as mentioned in the textbook.

1611
01:18:01,185 --> 01:18:01,685
Questions.

1612
01:18:01,685 --> 01:18:05,260

1613
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:06,142
All right.

1614
01:18:06,142 --> 01:18:07,350
That's how to sign your name.

1615
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:11,170
Next time we'll talk about
rigidity and other fun linkage

1616
01:18:11,170 --> 01:18:12,720
problems.

1617
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:17,569
